10/12/2015,Amazon,5,Remington is quality,"My husband has a short, well kept beard and has a few beard trimmers but none are Remington so he was excited to give it a go. I personally swear by my Reminton ladies shaver so I already knew Remington has quality products.  The main thing and most important thing for my husband is that this is waterproof. He does like to shave in the shower, we do have a little shower mirror in there.  This shaver has a great hand feel, not too light, not too heavy and doesn't slip when wet. It has a 3 hour charge. It doesn't take my husband 3 hours to trim his beard (thank goodness) but it's nice for my husband because he travels overnight for his job and sometimes forgets his charger. This has titanium coated blades which give it a quality feel and smooth grooming experience. There are a total of 11 attachments including a nose hair trimmer!  It all packs up nicely in a zip up bag. My husband is always on the lookout for quality products that make his shaving/grooming easier and doesn't irritate his skin. He said this one ranks up there with the best.  My uncle has a full on beard, like thick and a few inches long and my husband suggested we get him this for Christmas."
10/13/2015,Amazon,5,Top-notch grooming kit by Remington,"This 11 piece shaving set is perfect for the guy who likes to have a beard but doesn't want to spend a lot of time and money on grooming. I got this for my son who lives overseas, so he could use it when he visits me. It is handy and lightweight but gets the job done. He really likes the nose, ear and eyebrow hair trimmer attachment too.  It uses a lithium battery and the charge lasts for 3 hours. All of the 11 pieces fit neatly into a zippered case which is included, so it is a great grooming kit for travel as well. Since it is 100% waterproof, it may be used in the shower also which is a real plus for guys on the go!"
10/15/2015,Amazon,5,makes trimming/shaping beard much easier,"I find this trimmer to be much easier to use than the integrated trimmed on my Braun shaver.  The battery seems to last for days without any noticeable slowdown.  Going on almost a week now.  The blade is quite sharp, making quick work of the very thick hairs I have.  I am quite happy thus far with how this produce handles and performs.  Inwill nm provide regular updates to let you know how this trimmer has held up over time.  Hopefully it will last as long as my Panasonic combo shaver/trimmer which I've had for almost 10 years now."
10/17/2015,Amazon,5,"Great shaver, most people will want the Remington Crafter (not the Beardsman)","Remington has 2 new product lines, each with Regular vs Deluxe: The Craftsman (Regular vs Deluxe Copper Edition), and The Beardsman (Regular vs Deluxe Copper Edition).  The Copper editions are more sleek looking (with the copper finish), come with more accessories, and the heads are a little heavier duty. Plus, the Copper editions are only about $10 more expensive, which is probably worth it.  The Beardsman is for thicker beards - it has a detail trimmer on the shaver unit, but otherwise, most of the attachments are comb trimmers for long thick beards. The Crafter has much more versatile features. It seems to have basically the same comb attachments as the Beardsman, plus lots of extras: A mini roil shaver, nose & ear trimmer, in addition to the comb attachments.  Also, for the same price, the Crafter gives you 60 minutes more battery life with a Max Lithium Battery (3 hrs vs. 2 hrs). I suspect most people will want the Crafter.  Both models have titanium coated blades, which really makes a difference. Titanium is stronger, stays sharp longer, and more resistant to clogging & rust. This makes either of these Remington products super to most other shavers out there.  Finally, these Remington ""Beard Boss"" products aren't just for beards. The Crafter's heavy duty blades work for trimming hair, shaving heads, ""manscaping"" other body parts, and work great for simple goatees as well."
