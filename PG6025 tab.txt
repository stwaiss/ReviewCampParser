1/23/2015	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Nice little trimmer
1/23/2015	Amazon	1	Doesn't use A/C power	"I wouldn't give it one star. (1) it does  not run on a/c power when plugged-in, so it drains the battery. (2) the battery sucks in that it has a very short life (3) the battery dies so fast after being a year old that it's worthless."

1/27/2015	Amazon	1	One Star	"Doesn't really do a good job, waste of purchase. Blades aren't sharp not a serious purchase."
1/27/2015	Amazon	5	"Great product, really convenient when washing because the tips ..."	"Great product, really convenient when washing because the tips come right off. So far NO PROBLEMS AT ALL. Absolutely worth the price."
1/27/2015	Amazon	2	Disposable	"Disposable razor.  The battery is weak to begin with, and only gets worse fast.  Mine lasted about 9 months and is now trash.  Unconscionable to make something this hard to recycle that is essentially disposable.  Look for another razor."
1/29/2015	Amazon	5	Good price and quality product	"After buying cheap grooming tools and have it break in just a few uses, I settled to buy this product.  The price is excellent and the quality of the product is very good. If you are like me the buying cheap grooming tools, it is best to settle on a quality product for a few dollars more. You will not be disappointed with the purchase."
1/31/2015	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Great price deal.
2/1/2015	Amazon	5	Great	This is great. I have hairy little dogs and I use this to keep them neat between haircuts.
2/2/2015	Amazon	1	RIPPED OFF	"WRONG ITEM! They gave me the PG6015, a device that's HALF the price of this one. IT LACKS ITEMS: (foil, nose/ear, and carrying pouch) I even paid extra for one-day shipping  I paid one day shipping for a reason so now I have to bite the bullet and use this OVERPAID item.  It would be nice if there was another way to leave feedback or request some sort of compensation for how much I overpaid. Unfortunately, my only options are to request a return or leave this feedback.  It's more money wasted to ship this crap back, so I'm stuck with it. I'm very upset and frustrated now."
2/4/2015	Amazon	3	"good customer service, questionable battery life"	"after about a year or two it doesn't hold a charge.  After a long charge, only works for a few seconds.  Even early on, you only get about 20-30 seconds of use before it dies.  update 2/17/15 I've added another star since Remington contacted me to issue a replacement.  I appreciate the customer service.  I'll update the review after I've tested this one out for a while.  The box claims the razor will hold a charge for 50 min."
2/5/2015	Amazon	5	Great Trimmer/Shaver.	Great all purpose shaver/trimmer. Yes it is made in China but the quality seems pretty good and it works very well. For 20$ you can't go wrong. If you don't like it you can use it to groom your pets.
2/6/2015	Amazon	5	the lights don't tell you if the item is charged or not just light up when plugged in but overall good for its price	"Works well, the lights don't tell you if the item is charged or not just light up when plugged in but overall good for its price"
2/6/2015	Amazon	4	Review after eighteen months: A decent trimmer if your expectations are realistic.	"After owning and using this Remington trimmer for about three months, we have found it to be of decent quality.  Overall it performs well.  It comes with a lithium rechargeable battery which is both a good feature  (powerful, ecofriendly and no expensive batteries to frequently replace) and a downside to this (when that battery goes/malfunctions, this trimmer is also done because it is cost prohibitive to replace).  As far as performance goes a charge will initially get you about twenty minutes of power; that time will gradually decrease with repeated charges.  The assorted attachments are pretty good (except for the foil shaver which is a bust) if you have realistic expectations from this trimmer. It is not intended to be a barber-quality trimmer so if that is your hope, shop for an Oster or an Andis or something.  This is best suited for between haircut touch-ups, facial hair neatening and body grooming.  We bought this while it was on sale to replace a failing AA-battery powered Microtouch and in comparison this unit is leagues better.  It operates quietly and trims closely and comfortably.  For the price (especially the sale price) this was a good buy.  Hopefully it will last a few years.  If there is no update here assume this trimmer continues to function well.  UPDATE 6/30/16:  This trimmer gets used five or six times a month by my family and it continues to trim comfortably and effectively and the battery still holds a nice charge."
2/8/2015	Amazon	1	Garbage doesn't keep or take a charge....	Garbage battery only took a charge for about a month... and would die in 5 mins. Now won't even take a charge.... bought one as a gift same time... and same thing happened. Don't waste your money. Buy a Norelco! Hate giving 1 star...

2/11/2015	Amazon	1	Terrible battery life	"Didn't do that great of a job shaving or trimming. But worse of all, the battery charged only once. The product was useless afterwards, since it wouldn't take another charge after first use. Waste of $20"
2/13/2015	Amazon	5	Five Stars	worth the money!
2/14/2015	Amazon	1	One Star	a perfect example of cost cutting until you have a useless hand held tird

2/19/2015	Amazon	4	Works Great!	Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it.  Only complaint is it didn't fit in the medicine cabinet like the old one he had.
2/21/2015	Amazon	3	"its just ok, that it."	"Not the sharpest blades in the world. They're pretty dull and makes a 10mins shaving turn to a 30 mins or more. Please do not use the foil, it completely destroyed my face with razor bumps. For its price, it matches the quality. But this is not something to buy if you are looking for quality and high performance."

3/7/2015	Amazon	1	Chinese junk.	Chinese junk.  The battery will not stay charged for more than an hour.  Remington should recall this product.
3/8/2015	Amazon	3	I have a disappointment with the attachments	"While they have upgrade the motor (it feels more powerful). I have a disappointment with the attachments. The ones on the older model were better. The grooves are every 2mm and the gap I found is too long for trimming a short beard. The beard attachments are useless unless you want to keep a long beard also. My attachments from the previous model remington don't fit it either. Great for trimming clean, or keeping a long beard - crap if you're after a short neatly kept beard."
3/9/2015	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Product arrived in good condition, works very well!"
3/10/2015	Amazon	5	Great trimmer!	Battery lasts forever!
3/12/2015	Amazon	5	but that was after several years and lots of use so I definitely feel like we got our money's worth	"I purchased this to replace a similar all-in-one that I purchased a couple years ago.  I use it to keep my husbands haircut looking fresh between cuts.  We had to replace the original (also a Remington) because it stopped taking a charge, but that was after several years and lots of use so I definitely feel like we got our money's worth."

3/17/2015	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Great buy at a great price.
3/20/2015	Amazon	4	Great Shaver for Great Price	"I purchased this for my husband 2 years ago and he never had any issues with it at all. It stayed sharp and working (and he basically used the same attachment ALL the time) for a very long time. However, after 2 years of use it started getting a little dull so I purchased a second one 3 months ago (just to replace the old one and to have all the pieces again) and it quit working after a few uses. We purchased the same one AGAIN from Walmart and it has worked fine for 2-3 months now. So, maybe we just got a dud.  Had it not went bad after a few uses.... I would have given this a 5 stars.  It is a great shaver for a really good price."
3/21/2015	Amazon	4	Good for beard trimming and manscaping	"I do not use it as a shaver, nor the nose trimmer.  I only use the edger, with and without a guard. I find the edger cuts well. I typically let my beard grow out for about a week and then I use the edger directly to knock my beard down to a stubble.  This mows my beard down without difficulty.  I also use it with the shortest guard on my underarm and man-bush.  It gives those areas a groomed, respectable look without having to shave it to the skin.  Finally, about once a month I use the edger directly on my chest and stomach to take that hair down to a stubble.  I'm a medium hairy guy and this trimmer handles it all just fine.  I don't have any battery troubles.  I can do all the manscaping: chest/stomach, underarm, and the toolbox all on a single charge.  It's held up for 6 months or so with not problems. It's done what I expect for it's price point.  Also, I had a similar product from a company that starts with the letter ""C"" and this cuts much better."
3/22/2015	Amazon	5	Five Stars	My pubes are no longer a problem.  Get it? Longer. Ha!
3/26/2015	Amazon	5	Does the job at a bargain price	"The unit is powerful. The old unit I purchased this to replace was coincidentally also made my Remington. It came in a rechargeable base. It cost the same as this when new and was literally half the size of this unit but after 10 years stopped recharging. I was very pleased at the much larger size of this unit for such an economical price. The attachments are varied in size and work well. The foil shaver attachment seems to work fine in spite of it being reviewed poorly by others. Just speculation but the foil shaver looks like it should perform like the usual hand held authentic shavers that we're used to seeing. I suspect that users want it to perform like the expensive full sized $100+ electric shavers due to the look of the similarly appearing foil shield. It's not engineered to perform at that level. This is not a shaver, it's a trimmer and performs excellently in that capacity. I fully charged this unit when purchased about 5 or 6 weeks ago. When I turn it on today the unit feels as fully charged and powerful as right after the first and only charge to date."

"Sigh , i had such high expectations from this razor , it suddenly stopped charging the second time i tried to recharge it , i used it for like 5-6 times before it eventually lost its charge and then when i tried to recharge it , it was gone . no blinking lights turned on and the razor stopped working completely , i m not sure if theres a warranty on this . i m really really disappointed with this razor , you are far better off buying an expensive and better one.  I wish i could give a better rating than this , for all the hassles this razor gave me w.r.t charging i m giving a total 1 stars(because i cant go lower than this on amazon)  for this and an advice for everyone to stop looking at this item on amazon and move on to better and more durable item ."

I usually plug mine in to charge when i'm not using it so battery isn't a problem.  I am however disappointed in the foil shaver. I was looking for something all in one that could help shave as well but the foil shaver just doesn't cut it.  Great for trimming my beard but bad for shaving... Not bad for the price of $20.
4/13/2015	Amazon	3	Giving it another try as I like all the attachment options	Replacement for the same thing that doesn't hold charge after a year. Giving it another try as I like all the attachment options.
4/18/2015	Amazon	5	Well Designed and Functional	"Great, durable product.  I've had mine for about two-months and it's still running on the original charge.  Size and design makes it easy to get at just about any place needing a trim."

5/20/2015	Amazon	5	Get one!	"For many years I used another brand of trimmer, but the last one I bought pulled my hairs way too often so I went searching for another trimmer. Picked this one. Wow! What a difference! Much more quiet, trims rather then pulls my beard, and was way less expensive. I'm impressed."
5/21/2015	Amazon	4	Four Stars	I like it. However it will be perfect if it's waterproof
5/21/2015	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Excellent
5/21/2015	Amazon	2	You get what you pay for	"I have had this for over a year now, and I wasn't impressed from the very beginning. The motor is underpowered, and I have to go over the same area multiple times for it to get a decent trim. Even with that, it still leaves a few longer hairs behind. The battery stopped holding its charge after just two months, and you can't run it directly off of the outlet power, so I have to leave it plugged in constantly. I will be replacing it soon, but will be reading reviews more carefully this time."

My old one gave me sooooo many problems when it came to charging it.  Can't believe 15 bucks will buy something that cuts this well. And FYI you can use it to trim anywhere, not just your face."
6/5/2015	Amazon	5	You need this today!	"I love this thing! or rather it`s predecessor, the PG520 which seems to be the same except that the older model had a nicer bronze/taupe colour.  It comes with amazing accessories and it works great on head to almost down there. The body trimmer is great for the lightning fast close trim on torso and you can detail that with the foil shaver (not really meant for your beards guys). The wider trimmer with combs also allows you to trim up in between haircuts with ease.  The only downside is for real personal grooming, you can go ahead and put this one away and pull out the unbeatable Japanese Clean Cut trimmer.  Overall, this product gives you really fantastic value for the money and for the innovative, rake-style body trimmer attachment alone it is worth twice the price."
6/6/2015	Amazon	5	Five Stars	item worked perfectly as described.
6/8/2015	Amazon	5	Great Trimmer!	Great trimmer for all around use.  Holds charge well too.

6/21/2015	Amazon	5	The best body trimmer for men	"This is great body hair trimmer. The blades are smooth and the design is very good to cover almost entire body. There are sufficient attchments to cover the various hair lenghts and the trimming requirements. I had its predecessor PG520 for about 10 years until its battrey gave up. The blades were still doing well and would have worked for another few years. The new version is defintiely much better as the charging cable can be connected directly to the trimmer instead of fitting it into the base at an awkward angle. The battery life is much more, i believe upto an hour.  And yes, you can use it while the charging cable is connected. The base is very nice and can keep all attachments while being stable so things are not falling apart. Overall, an excellent product with reasoanble price."
6/22/2015	Amazon	5	Big fan of this product	"Keeps me from looking TOO manly, and scaring off men and women alike. I've found that I don't really care for the nose/ear trimmer attachment, but I only used it as a novelty anyway, so that doesn't negatively affect my review. The foil doesn't pull my hair out (not that a manly man like me would mind such trivial pains) and the trimmer does a really good job with edging, to keep me from looking shabby. Battery life is pretty good, but I feel like it works better when plugged in."
6/23/2015	Amazon	4	"Solid Trimmer, nothing more"	Great trimmer- nothing heavy duty but gets the 'extras' quite well.  Would highly recommend to anyone using it for the first time to give a good charge first.

7/15/2015	Amazon	4	Four Stars	"it does the job, my husband its been using it for months now."
7/16/2015	Amazon	1	Junk	"I purchased this product about 2 weeks ago from the store. I got home and used it. Everything worked perfectly fine at first. After about a week of use however, the battery completely stopped charging. I would have the thing charging for a whole day and it would work for literally 20 seconds. Apparently the engineers who created such a piece of junk are not aware of how painful it can be to have a shaver stop working half way through the shaving process. I will make a point of never buying another Remington product in my life."

8/6/2015	Amazon	1	My son was not impressed.	"Returned, not the lithium we had wanted."
8/10/2015	Amazon	2	"Small drain on the budget, big drain on the battery"	"Fabulous price and I got what I paid for but I have one main, deal breaker of a complaint--the battery.  It is pitiful.  I found myself charging multiple days in a row just to get the battery to last 3-4 minutes for a quick shave, which was always anxiety provoking (you know, a half shaved face isn't what I was looking for).  I also found out the hard way that if you fully charge it and then leave it unplugged for a couple days thereafter, it's as if you never charged it--the battery is completely drained.  I learned an important lesson from this purchase--price shouldn't always direct my decision."
8/10/2015	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great
8/12/2015	Amazon	2	Just okay	"This trimmer isn't exactly what I had hoped it to be as a Remington product. My husband states that it doesn't cut as well as his last one, the storage for the attachment pieces isn't that great, and neither is the product storage for the unit itself. The storage unit doesn't really store anything because if it is touched ever so slightly, everything falls out and the unit itself just lays in the middle of the inadequate storage unit causing it to be accidentally knocked off the counter a lot as well. The battery life is awful so it has to stay plugged in or it will be dead when my husband is ready to use it. I definitely would not recommend this product to anyone."

8/17/2015	Amazon	5	Make your face happy!	"Wow! I bought this because of the brand, after I got disappointed from a few other cheaper ones I bought on eBay. Boy, I am glad I got this and am even happier now that I have it.  This has so many attachments, you will not be disappointed either.  Easy to care for and operate. Wish I had gone straight for this one and saved months of heartache (or face-ache!)."
8/18/2015	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great for taking off all kinds of man scaping. To pulling and nice clean shave.
8/18/2015	Amazon	3	Weak But Useful For Certain Areas	"This shaver is relatively weak, but that is why I bought it (Hint: not for my face). I have a far superior Phillips Norelco QT 4014, which is currently only ten dollars more, so if you're looking for a face and beard trimmer get that instead, but that one will bite into looser, more sensitive skin. This one isn't strong enough to break the skin unless you really press hard."

8/26/2015	Amazon	1	Poor quality product	Would be good if the battery lasted more than 30 seconds. Don't waste your money on this junk. I have bought two and they are both the same.
8/26/2015	Amazon	2	Skin burning trimmer	I really don't understand what's best in this trimmer. The steel plate near the blade turns real hot within 2 minutes and there after I cannot even trim as it starts burning my skin. And the trimmer isn't powerful as norelco. I will never consider this trimmer again.

8/27/2015	Amazon	4	Great Product	"I was a little leary of this product as I've had so many rechargeable things that die quickly after repeated use.  This item is handy and still going strong after six months.  I don't recommend using it to shave or cut hair despite the attachments.  Also, the charge doesn't last that long.  I downgrade it one star based on the charge issue, but its usefulness for shaving and hair cutting as i never intended to use it for that."
8/27/2015	Amazon	5	Works great.	I'm glad I didn't overspend. This product works great.
8/31/2015	Amazon	5	Good	"Nice product, i recomend"

It charges relatively quickly & it can be used while plugged in. It took me awhile to figure out how to remove the tip to use other attachments because the instructions weren't very clear, but once I figured that out it was easy to switch attachments. Decent battery life. I used it to shave my head and it took about 5 minutes total when my old kit took about twice as long. Using there one attachment I was able to get a smooth shave that meant I didn't need to use a disposable razor for my head or my face.  It would be nice if this came with a stand to house the unit when not in use (especially for charging purposes), but the bag is more than adequate to keep all of the accessories in one place.  Highly recommend this product. The price is right & the quality of shave is amazing!"

The attachments and lithium battery seem very much the same but the shaver works much more effortlessly. I can't really attest to its permanence yet - the only reason I got it in the first place is because the capacitance of the battery on the other product died and one of the razor blades broke off, so I will update my review in the future."

10/6/2015	Amazon	5	I love this thing	"I love this thing. While it's your average trimmer with a few less heads than I would like, it has one major perk [for me at least]: It uses the exact same heads as the PG6050. Which is excellent, because after numerous attempts, I have found that my PG6050 will not charge on US sockets. Bought this as an emergency replacement and it serves the purpose perfectly. Not only do I now have a trimmer with all the heads my old one had, but I have spare heads as well. So when one wears out or for whatever other reason is rendered unusable, I can just switch to a spare. And thanks to the fact the PG6050 has a body-hair trimmer head as well, I no longer have to purchase a third trimmer just for that purpose.  Only question left is how long they will last. From how they feel, I would say the PG6025 will pack in before the other one, but I doubt that will happen any sooner than a year from now. Will update this review if that does in fact occur, but as of now, I am completely satisfied with my purchase."
10/7/2015	Amazon	5	great product.	"Amazon Prime purchase.  Speedy  delivery, great product."
10/8/2015	Amazon	5	Excellent	"Had the previous version of this razor and I broke the most important attachment.  Originally I was just going to order that part but I saw it was $7, and the entire clippers package, new version, with all the attachments was only $15 so figured might as well.  Love the new version, cuts a lot smoother than last one.  No more red neck after getting a trim up on back of head.  Great buy."

10/10/2015	Amazon	2	Battery does not keep charge.	"I got mine about 20 months ago. It worked well for a while, but now the battery does not keep a charge. I charged it for ~8 hours two days ago, let it sit, and it stayed on for under 60 seconds when I tried to use it today. The charger will not let you operate it plugged in. That is, if you have a dead battery, you can't plug it in and have it work; it needs to be charged and used separately. When charged and functioning properly, the cutters work well, but the foil shaver and adjustable clipping guard are mediocre."
10/13/2015	Amazon	1	the blades have gone poor. Doesn't cut through properly	"After around 10 uses, the blades have gone poor. Doesn't cut through properly. Also after initial 2-3 uses, started making a lot of noise compared to when it was new. I use it just one a month and that too only for beard. I didn't expect it to be this low performing this soon. Also the nose trimmer and shaver is a waste. Mere toys to increase the number of items in the package."
10/13/2015	Amazon	5	Disposable trimer	I had problems with the battery and after maybe 20 charging cycles it would no longer take a charge so I contacted Remington and they immediately sent me a new unit. So far its working great and their customer service was excellent.
10/13/2015	Amazon	1	battery died under 6 months	"Love the razor and attachments but the battery has become completely worthless in less than 6 months.  It won't hold a charge and will only run for about 5-10 seconds. the razor was great while it worked though.  Good attachments, great washability, never had to oil..."

10/16/2015	Amazon	4	"Works Good, no problems using it continuously plugged into power."	Good Quality and great for trimming beards.  I use it every week and it has been working well.  I don't know how long it would run on battery only.

10/20/2015	Amazon	5	Great trimmer	This is a great trimmer. I've had it for around a month and it has not needed charged with light daily use. Probably the best trimmer I've owned out of the half a dozen or so in my life.

11/1/2015	Amazon	5	Great general purpose beard and hair trimmer	"After going through several beard and other facial trimmers, I finally ended up with this one.  I was actually looking for a battery powered one, but those did not turn out too well for me.  I had a Ronson that probably lasted 10 years before it died that was battery powered.  It has so good that I actually bought a second one and retired all my other beard trimmers.  No cuts or nicks as a general rule (unlike another brand/model that will remain nameless).  The rechargeable battery life is great - beats every other rechargeable trimmer that I have had."

12/2/2015	Amazon	5	Liked it more than I thought I would	I hate shaving and use beard and mustache trimmers to shave without attachments and i get clise enough shave. Mine recently was dying and I bought this. It works better than my last one and the foil shaver attachment it comes with works very good for me. I have never used a foil shaver before and now I find I like it and didnt burn and tear my face up like the round blade electric shavers. I did not use anything before shaving. Just dry skin. Like it alot!

12/7/2015	Amazon	5	GREAT price and works perfectly!	"Soooo, I was VERY skeptical (and I've only owned this for a day so far) based on the CHEAP price. The cheapest one I could find at Target was 60 bucks and didn't even have all the attachments this one has. I used it and there was no hair pulling/pinching. I used every attachment just to play around with it. Everything worked great. The only thing I noticed was it's very light weight...which some people may love. Heck, I could go through four of these before I'd have paid for one of the razors at Target lol."

12/12/2015	Amazon	5	The cutting power is great. Use for beard and head.	"The materials feel solid, and the cutting power is great.  I use it for my beard as well as my head.  I wasn't sure if it would work for the head because it is smaller than normal clippers, but cuts very well and seems to work fine (I keep my hair cropped very closely).  Definitely recommend."

12/19/2015	Amazon	1	Threw it out	Arrived on time and packaged well. I took it from the box and plugged it into the wall to charge the battery. It did not work. Would not turn on at all. Due to it`s low price it was easier for me to just throw it away instead of spending the time and effort to box it and return the piece of junk. Just wanted to enlighten those who may choose to order this item.
12/20/2015	Amazon	4	It's good	I felt quite satisfield with your product. It's good
12/20/2015	Amazon	5	Well worth the $15	"I bought this because I hate shaving but have to keep a near-clean shaven appearance for work. I wasn't too sure how it would work or hold up for $15, but I've used it for over a year every 2-3 days and it's worked amazingly. It trims nice and close to my face, and doesnt leave a 5 oclock shadow evem with my very dark hair. Oh, and it doesn't need to be charged much, I think I do once every month or two.  I tried to cut my hair with it once too, but it takes way too long. It's great for trimming around the ears though.  I'd definitely buy it again, and I will."
12/20/2015	Amazon	1	Not a good product. I bought it for the cheap price	"Not a good product. I bought it for the cheap price, but it doesn't hold a charge well and you can't use it while charging. I just threw mine away a few days ago because the product stopped working altogether. Avoid this product."
12/20/2015	Amazon	5	Excelent	I love it
12/21/2015	Amazon	4	Seems Fine	This seems to work rather well for the one time I've used it so far. It should serve it's purpose especially for the money.

12/26/2015	Amazon	5	Excellent. Battery life has been great	"Excellent. Battery life has been great. I have fully charged this device once and have used it around four times without a recharge, each session lasting around 15-20 minutes. The attachments are also awesome and useful."
12/26/2015	Amazon	3	"It's $15 worth, but that's about it"	"I purchased this elsewhere, but it ran about $15, and I figure I got about $15 worth out of it.  It was okay in the beginning, lasting through 3 or 4 shaves. I was disappointed I couldn't ""run off the cord"" if it wasn't charged, but again...it's a $15 razor. I wasn't expecting much. It's been about a year and a half now and now it won't hold a charge more than about 15 seconds. Luckily I haven't had anyone ask why one side of my beard is shorter than the other. ;)"
12/27/2015	Amazon	1	This is a One Star Item	"After a dozen uses, the razor stopped working and no amount of charge would resurrect it.  Too bad the battery is not replaceable.  This is a completely disposable item.  I do not recommend this item."
12/28/2015	Amazon	3	Poor battery power	Nice trimmer but poor battery power. The battery fluctuates while in use even immediately after a full charge. Battery discharges quickly
12/28/2015	Amazon	5	Buy this trimmer!	Good little trimmer.  Holds charge for a looooong time!  Also gets in to all the tight spaces.  Would highly recommend over other similar products.  Great value.
12/29/2015	Amazon	4	Like this trimmer so far...	I've only used the trimmer once but it seems to be a pretty good buy. Had to buy this after buying a battery operated one (hate those). I like the accessories but wish it had the lubricating oil and cleaning brush.
12/30/2015	Amazon	1	"Battery always sucked, but has continually gotten worse"	"Had for two years. Battery always sucked, but has continually gotten worse. Dies after one minute even if fully charged."
12/30/2015	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Bought this as a gift for my dad and he loves it.
12/30/2015	Amazon	1	"Garbage, literally"	"I just threw mine in the trash -- long charge times, short run times, and no battery or plug in backup. That's a recipe for an incomplete shave and getting stuck. What event do you want that to happen in front of? You get what you pay for. Im going back to Osterizers -- my last set lasted 20 years before they got lost."
12/30/2015	Amazon	5	Great trimmer. My son loves it	Great trimmer. My son loves it. Read the ad on the trimmer. Remington has been a great trimmer. It has several different attachments. Great buy for the money!
1/3/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Love this thing, all it does is work evertime I turn it on."

1/5/2016	Amazon	1	Don't Buy	"Even while plugged in, it will not turn on. I have left it charging for a whole day and still nothing. This thing worked maybe twice then broke. Garbage."
1/6/2016	Amazon	4	GOOD TRIMMER	"Suits its purpose, reasonably priced"
1/6/2016	Amazon	5	Great built quality and great warranty	Great built quality and great warranty. Very happy with the battery lasting long and has many adapters.
1/6/2016	Amazon	2	Remington PG525 Does Shave	"This item is satisfactory when shaving/trimming body hair, but does not perform al all when shaving or trimming facial hair. When using this item between shaves when I used a razor, almost none of my facial hair is cut. It just doesn't shave."
1/7/2016	Amazon	5	Nice clipper nice price	"Great price, works well. It comes with several attachments to clean up nose hair, ear hair, clean up your haircut maybe even letting you go a little longer in between cuts. I didn't want to pay a ton for a clipper that no matter what price you pay, they end up losing power eventually. This is great and I would buy it again."
1/9/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Best personal groomer ***** Love it
1/9/2016	Amazon	4	decent shaver for the price	"Cuts well and provides a close enough shave that looks presentable yet prevents ingrown hairs like a razor ...doesn't pinch or pull nor create any nicks, so feels safe enough to use anywhere. The attachments aren't the best... the battery holds a long enough charge to provide multiple uses before needing to be recharged. It definitely lacks some cutting power though so it usually takes a couple passes to cleanly cut thicker facial hair. All in all a decent shaver for the price that gets the job done."
1/11/2016	Amazon	4	It doesn't seem to want to work at all but all the different attachments work well and are easy to clean under running water	I bought this for my son and he really likes it. He said it works perfectly all except the foil razor. It doesn't seem to want to work at all but all the different attachments work well and are easy to clean under running water.
1/12/2016	Amazon	1	One Star	Doesn't fine cut for sharp lines.
1/12/2016	Amazon	1	Blunt and inefficient	"I do not like this device at all! It's very blunt so almost always I have to do the job with classic manual razor, because this device did not manage to cut tiny hair. Other additional appliances seem equally inefficient and blunt. Waste of money!"
1/14/2016	Amazon	5	Works well	East to use. Trims  great. Can't beat fot about 15 bucks.
1/14/2016	Amazon	3	"It's ok, needs a stand."	"The style is awesome, it works very well and the attachments are all what you need to trim your beard, mustache, etc. My only complain will be that it doesn't have a stand to put them. It comes with a bag but this is the first trimmer that I buy without a stand."
1/17/2016	Amazon	3	A Bit disappointing	"Ive been using now for over a month. It works just ok. I feel like it is underpowered, like it has low batteries, except I keep it plugged in! I have had a few instances where trimming with various attachments it has pulled hair out instead of cutting, a sign it is not powerful enough. It works, but I will not get another Remington product."
1/17/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	works great
1/18/2016	Amazon	5	Perfect for a touch up!	I bought the Remington all in one for my BF and he loved it. He uses it for a quick touch up. Easy to use and works great
1/19/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	good so far. just DONT use the Foil thing. its terrible. leaves patches everywhere.
1/19/2016	Amazon	4	"Superb trimmer, not so good holder for it"	"This is a excellent trimmer, because it is lithium powered and rechargeable, but I don't like the holder for this PG525 model.  I bought this model as a replacement for the PG520 model, which died on me after one year of use.  But the holder on the PG520 is much better.  For these reasons, I gave 4 out of 5 stars."
1/20/2016	Amazon	3	Three Stars	Not as good as the one it is replacing.  But it does the job.
1/21/2016	Amazon	5	"I purchased this for my son, from what he ..."	"I purchased this for my son, from what he told me he is very please with it. He said it gave him a vrery clean soft looking skin."
1/23/2016	Amazon	1	Stops working shortly after purcjase	Doesn't hold a charge and stopped working at all after four months.
1/23/2016	Amazon	5	Nice tremer.	I like the attachments they help get a perfect length every time.It's always charged and reedy to go.
1/23/2016	Amazon	1	"Two times bought, one leason learned: do not buy"	"I have bought this product 2 times, after that my conclusion is this: 1. Battery life is awful, you must keep this charging basically 2. After few weeks, the adaptor gets damaged.  I tested with the multimeter and it does not produce current to power the shaver"
1/24/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	great product would recommend

1/25/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	It works great.
1/25/2016	Amazon	5	Nice For Price	Got it as a gift. The person really liked it and raved about how sharp it was and that he liked it better than his old one. I personally thought it was a bit big.

1/26/2016	Amazon	1	It's Really Disposable!! Stay Away.	Got one for Christmas.  It lasted until 1/26. Give a new meaning to disposable.  Stay away from this one.
1/27/2016	Amazon	4	Otherwise it is a very good product.	Nose trimmer is not effective in trimming nose hair.  Otherwise it is a very good product.

1/28/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works just fine.
1/28/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	My grandson loves it.
1/28/2016	Amazon	3	Good for dog feet. Probably not powerful enough for beard.	It's worth it for the price. I'm using it to trim the bottom of my dogs feet. I don't think it would be powerful enough to cut thick course hair though.
1/29/2016	Amazon	2	Two Stars	Battery didn't last a month

"I bought this because I hate shaving but have to keep a near-clean shaven appearance for work. I wasn't too sure how it would work or hold up for $15, but I've used it for over a year every 2-3 days and it's worked amazingly. It trims nice and close to my face, and doesnt leave a 5 oclock shadow evem with my very dark hair. Oh, and it doesn't need to be charged much, I think I do once every month or two.  I tried to cut my hair with it once too, but it takes way too long. It's great for trimming around the ears though.  I'd definitely buy it again, and I will recommend to my friends for sure."

2/3/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Close cut with minimum noise.
2/3/2016	Amazon	5	Best trimmer I've had	Best trimmer I've had yet. Had the Braun full body trimmer before. This battery lasts twice as long and I just use the default blade for a 5 o'clock shadow look and it works terrific.
2/4/2016	Amazon	4	"Rechargeable, but not water proof. Overall really good razor."	"I've been using the same Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler 3-In-1 Men's Body Groomer With Beard Trimmer for a few years now and was in need of a new trimmer. I bought this Remington at Target a little over a month ago and am extremely happy with it so far. The main reason I bought it was because it is rechargeable.  I use it on average about every other day. The charge lasts me for anywhere between 1 to 2 weeks without being plugged in at all. It also remains at a mostly constant output of power up until it is dead. The Proglide Styler ate though AA batteries like crazy. It would slowly loose power and I was often was replacing batteries just because the trimmer would slow down too much. I like this one much better. I keep the Gillette, but only for the razor attachment now.  I really only use the trimmer and foil shaver attachment. All of the extra attachments are kind of pointless for me; besides my face and neck there isn't much else that I shave regularly. The trimmer is wide and seems to be good quality. The foil shaver is decent. I use it to avoid razor burn, but it is far from efficient. The stand was a little warped, but that wasn't a big deal. The only downside to this trimmer is that it isn't water proof, whereas the Gillette is. I'm saving a fortune on batteries though, so when it comes time for a new one, I will probably buy this product again."
2/4/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	My husband is loving it
2/5/2016	Amazon	1	Too much money for a disposable razor	This is a great product if you buy it knowing you want a disposable razor and plan to buy a new one every other month. That is when the battery will no longer take a charge. This product should have been recalled and the problem fixed.
2/6/2016	Amazon	4	Wroks okay.	This item works and little hard to clean.
2/6/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	nice product works well and charge well
2/7/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Perfect gift
2/8/2016	Amazon	4	EXCELLENT QUALITY!	"Remington PG6025 All-in-1 Lithium Powered Grooming Kit, Black is promoted as being a product for men yet I have found that it is just as great for us ladies. The various attachments are awesome!! The foil one works well for maintenance of underarms and legs. The combs are wonderful for keeping the pubic area neat and trim, as well as, maintaining a short coiffed cut without having to set aside time and money for a trip to the salon. The basic trimmer ( it comes packed with that one in place) is awesome for keeping the nape, front hairline and sideburns under control. The ear/nose one I use for my eyebrows when I am in a hurry and just need to tidy them up - it is also great for detail and/or design trimming of coif or pubic area. It is most definitely NOT made for any heavy duty trimming of your cranial hair, lol. I use my Oster for that then use the Remington for details and maintenance."
2/9/2016	Amazon	4	Cheap....does the job for the guy who keeps 24/7 scruff	"The best cheapo wireless stubble cutter I have tried. Better than my Phillips. It will die on you after a year of 2x-weekly use though. Hence the price, and hence the 4* review instead of 5."
2/10/2016	Amazon	5	decent	works better than a barber trimmer.
2/10/2016	Amazon	1	One Star	Excellent product and service. Will use again.

It does pull my neck hairs when trimming the bottom of my beard but normally all of the trimmers do that. If you are looking to tame your beard, this is definitely what you need."
2/12/2016	Amazon	4	Cuts and Trims Nicely	"Nice unit, holds a charge much better then ones I have had in the past.  Wish it had a depth adjustable head instead of having to switch combs.  Other then that, excellent product."
2/12/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Exelent
2/12/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	great accesory
2/13/2016	Amazon	5	Love this product. I use it about 4 times a week and rarely needs recharging.  What did they put in there?	"Great product. I'm amazed at how long and strong the batteries last in this thing. I seriously wonder what kind of battery it is.  I don't have to recharge it often. I use it pretty much every other day and have only charged it like twice in 2 months.  I like the main trimmer and the smaller trimmer also. I swap them out a lot.  Good product.  The only thing that would make it better is if it was waterproof.  Oh well, can't have everything."
2/14/2016	Amazon	5	Great shaver with multiple guide lengths!!	"this was my 2nd shaver of this exact model, i had to buy a new one because i forgot my charger when i went on vacation and used a cord from a different device. I did not look at the amp reading for the cord which was much higher than what this shaver was designed for and i fried my internal components. I was very happy with the quality of this shaver along with all of the attachments and guides will provide you with the perfect length cut."
2/14/2016	Amazon	5	Thank you	"Super, I liked it .  Works great"
2/14/2016	Amazon	3	Three Stars	So far so good
2/14/2016	Amazon	1	Not sharp	"I was excited to get these trimmers, but there were really dull. I had to really press on my husband's neck and they still didn't work."
2/14/2016	Amazon	5	I've had great luck with this	"I use it primarily with the shortest guard to trim down my beard every one or two weeks. The short guard is also effective for protecting your sensitive parts when doing a ""lower unit"" trim. I'd been looking for a good way to do this for years, and this is it  I charge the battery for maybe 10 or 15 minutes each time I use it. I have yet to have it die on me after over a year of ownership. And mine does work when the charger is plugged in as well"
2/15/2016	Amazon	1	One Star	"This razor is junk, wont hold a charge after a year of minimal use."
2/15/2016	Amazon	5	Awesome product and well worth it for the price	Great simple trimmer for all the jobs.
2/16/2016	Amazon	3	Battery stopped charging in under 1 month	"This lasted a few trims when it was working fine. Within a month though, the batter refused to charge. Every time I plugged it in (for hours), it would switch on for about 10 seconds, then stop. This is a poor product and doesn't deserve the reviews it has.  EDIT: I'm improving my rating to 3 stars for the prompt service from the manufacturer."
2/16/2016	Amazon	5	Good product .	"I use this to trim my beard low. It does an awesome job at keeping me looking well groomed. The battery life is really good, I would say I charge it once a week ( daily use ) ."
2/16/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Product performs as advertised.
2/17/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great shaver!
2/18/2016	Amazon	5	Awesome.	"Shaves great and quietly.  Awesome item for price.  Fully charged and after about 6-8 shaves,  battery is still going strong with out recharge."
2/18/2016	Amazon	1	Very difficult to fit different cutting heads.	The problem for me is that I find it difficult to well-nigh impossible to fit the different cutting attachments (combs) onto the razor.  I'm stuck with one comb fitted and I daren't take it off in case I can't get it on again.  I am planning to throw this razor out as soon as I can find a better one to replace it.
2/18/2016	Amazon	5	Super performance and value	"My beard was pretty thick when I grew tired of it.  This puppy did the job quickly and efficiently, cutting the curly growth down to a manageble length so I could shave.  The attachments worked nicely too.  I used the larger attachment to trim around my ears a bit.  I was actually surprised how well it cut.  I definitely recommend it if you want to eliminate your beard entirely or thin it out to scruff length.  For the price, it performs like more expensive trimmers I've owned."
2/19/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Nice product. I use it everyday. This is the second one I've bought.
2/19/2016	Amazon	5	Excellent	Excellent
2/19/2016	Amazon	1	Does Not Hold A Charge	"This Remington PG6025 Trimmer does not hold a charge. It was a great little hair trimmer while it worked, but after a few months it no longer held a charge long enough to trim around my husband's ears and neck line. It had very little power and would completely die half-way around his head (no matter how long I charge it for). It's unfortunate that you don't have the option of using it while plugged into the charger wall unit, you can only use the trimmer once unplugged from the wall charger. Don't waste your money on this weak lithium powered trimmer, purchase yourself a corded unit."
2/20/2016	Amazon	5	You don't want to compare this with the costlier ones. I can say this: It works good.	"Though not best, it is good."
2/22/2016	Amazon	5	Nice trimmer.	Very good trimmer. Has lots of attachments.

2/29/2016	Amazon	1	Don't Bother	Stopped holding a charge within a month. Don't bother.
3/1/2016	Amazon	1	Piece of JUNK!!! Don't buy	"This product is a piece of JUNK!! Don't waste your money!! I can't fathom why it is rated so high. Contrary to other postings, this trimmer will NOT work while being charged. And speaking of charging, after your initial charge has worn out, the chances of it being fully charged a second time are 50-50 at best... If it does hold a second charge, it's a mixed blessing. You get to use it a few more times, but you will probably miss the return time frame allowed by whatever retailer you purchased it from. I've had two of these, (not purchased from Amazon though) so I speak from experience. Bottom line: this trimmer is GARBAGE. Buy something else!!!"

The razor is the perfect balance between being compact in size and easy to hold. The blades, which are self sharpening, are highly effective, clipping hair without any of the painful pulling that you get from other razors. The razor comes with a collection of guides to control the length of the cut.  These attach well and there doesn't seem to be any risk of them coming loose during use. Being cordless makes it easy to use outside or in a bathroom where there is no power source.  The battery is quick to charge and long lasting."

3/20/2016	Amazon	3	Battery stopped working in  less than a year	"I received this initially as a gift last Christmas and when I first recoil,  it was great, plenty of extension gave it a lot of different uses.  It took a long time to charge,  but I didn't think much of it because most razors in this price range too. I then began to realize if I left it off the charger for more than a week,  that I would die entire and I would have to charge it another 12 hours to use it,  making it very difficult.  And now just recently,  the battery won't charge at all,  and it will no longer turn on,  no matter how long it sits on the charger. Terrible product and I will not be buying from Remington again.  EDIT: I received a new one and great customer support, without even having a receipt and I sent the old one back. It's only been about a month since then so I can't comment on the battery life, but they get an extra start because of the great customer service. Will update on battery if there are issues again."

"The unit itself is great with one proviso - unless you have two or three inch hair on your back the body hair trimmer is difficult to use at best. One other thought, if you are buying it for the storage stand, don't bother, save your money and get it with a storage bag instead. All you have to do is look at the storage stand and parts of the razor 'stored' on it fall over."

3/23/2016	Amazon	3	I have found that a good fix for this is frequent cleaning (duh) and oil	"This is my third one. Although they dont last long, they are cheap and can be charged overseas. They are also the only trimmer with an attachable guard (not the adjustable ones) which is short enough to trim the mustache. All the others are too long and cant trim the mustache well. I have noticed that the new model, they have improved the battery. It now holds a charge for a long time and doesnt completely die after a few charges. The problem with this model is that the motor seems to die since the blades are too tight. I have found that a good fix for this is frequent cleaning (duh) and oil. Also not overtightening the screws on the cutting plate."

4/1/2016	Amazon	1	I got it in end Dec and within a period ...	I got it in end Dec and within a period of 3 months went dead! Amazon says it cannot be returned!!!
4/2/2016	Amazon	5	awesome built quality	awesome built quality. feels like an expensive Wahl! fine blades and ergonomic design. way better tahn my old remington. Good job by the company over the years.
4/2/2016	Amazon	5	Highly Recommended	I've had this electric shaver for more than a year and the battery still lasts at least 2hrs on a single charge. The attachments allow for all types of body grooming.
4/3/2016	Amazon	3	Three Stars	Doesn't work well on short facial hair
4/4/2016	Amazon	4	Cool.	I use it to groom my dog. Lol. Works like a charm.
4/4/2016	Amazon	5	Good.	Delivered quickly. Good price. Works fine. Thank you.
4/4/2016	Amazon	5	Good Groomer!	Husband uses daily and loves all the attachments and options for grooming.  Good quality... The stand for the attachments is sad and they fall off if you bump it while wiping the counter.
4/5/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Better than I expected
4/5/2016	Amazon	5	A good product with a cheap deal	This product is awesome
4/6/2016	Amazon	3	Quite good for a $20 item	"It worked okay but in switching the heads bits of it would break off until I finally had to ditch it. That was annoying, because I didn't use it all that much, but on the other hand, it did last for a few years."
4/6/2016	Amazon	2	Beware... Doesn't last long.	Not a bad product. Have owned a few of these. Poor thing is that they don't hold their charge well. Last ine lasted about a year. This one I just purchased lasted only 3.5 weeks. Now it will not stay on for longer than 10 seconds.
4/6/2016	Amazon	4	Worth the money for sure Remington is a good brand.	"Came with everything , haven't used yet but seems as it will work well.... Worth the money for sure Remington is a good brand."
4/7/2016	Amazon	1	One Star	Breaks too easy
4/7/2016	Amazon	3	"It worked fine, but after 2 years it would not hold ..."	"It worked fine, but after 2 years it would not hold a charge, AT ALL. It completely died. Now shopping for a new trimmer."
4/8/2016	Amazon	1	Weak trimmer	"Flimsy, weak even when fully powered  glorified paperweight, snags on facial hair after only 5  days of non-shaving.."
4/10/2016	Amazon	3	it's great. However if you need it for precision	"If you are using this as a once over, it's great. However if you need it for precision, then you might be interested in another brand. I use this to do the finishing touches on my boyfriends hair cuts and it gets very hot after having it on for a minute. I have to constantly hold the metal end against a cold surface to keep the heat from irritating his skin. It's mostly good for areas where the flat end doesn't need to touch the skin, like around the ears or trimming the beard using a comb barrier. Decent trimmer but it just gets VERY hot VERY quickly."
4/12/2016	Amazon	3	SHAVE ME!!	"I have bought a few shavers in the past year and they all under perform and end up just plain not doing the job. This started cutting well in the beginning, but now i find it to be pulling ever so often; and that hurts and is becoming a minor annoyance. This product still works and cuts, but with a little snagging every now and then.  BODY GROOMING: For men out there who are interested in body grooming, this does a great job! It has multiple head attachments which allow for you to choose what amount of hair you want to leave, or just remove all attachments and trim down to skin.  BATTERY: When you first buy this item, plug it in and let it charge over night before its first use. After that, I find it holds a charge pretty well and allows for a good 5-6 long shaves + body hair before it needs another charge.  HEAT: It does not get to hot from use, I notice the heat start to pickup once you pass the 5 minute range.  WEIGHT: Do you even lift bro?  For the price, I cant complain to much. It is serving its purpose well enough; and has been a better purchase compared to other brands.. So ill stick with it."
4/12/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Remington makes a great product. Always rely on the name and product.
4/14/2016	Amazon	5	We love this shaver especially when we travel as it is ...	We love this shaver especially when we travel as it is easy to store and great to use in hotel rooms.  The several options are great specially the close trim as it prevents us from having to shave our arms and legs.  Love it!
4/14/2016	Amazon	5	Its a really great tool!	"This thing is a beast!  I shaved basicaly three cats worth of hair off my chest, and it wasnt slowing down.  Never pulled one hair.  I shave my face with it every day.  It isnt a real close shave but it only takes about 30 seconds.  It makes it look like I am about a day past a real shave, and thats good enough for the office I work in."
4/15/2016	Amazon	1	It can't cut hair	"This is the second time I have been burned(or cut rather) by Remington shavers. It wouldn't cut my facial hair, you the ONE thing its supposed to do. I tried the various heads it came with and all I got was a patchy face and skin irritation. You're better off taking your money and buying the cheapest disposable razors you can find."
4/17/2016	Amazon	1	They were nice enough to put it in a remington box for ...	"Ocean Reef Fulfillment sent me a used WAHL with a few hair attachments and a charger. They were nice enough to put it in a remington box for me though. I had this product before and it worked great, but please do not by it from here."
4/18/2016	Amazon	5	Good blades!	"Excellent quality, very sharp blades, even after several months of use.  No problems with pulling beard hairs and cleans up easily."
4/18/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	works as advertised
4/19/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Good
4/19/2016	Amazon	5	Good to Have	"A great hair trimmer for both domestic and barber use. I bought it for home use especially when I don't want to travel to the barber shop every so often. This trimmer is good for both trimming hair, beard, and mustache. An absolute great tool to have for cutting hair."
4/20/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	I use it once a week and i love it.
4/20/2016	Amazon	1	Disposable	"Its basically disposable!!! I bought one of these from a big box store about a year and a half ago, and it died suddenly after about 2 months. I exchanged it for a new one and it lasted about 5 months. I exchanged that one and the third lasted also about 5 months. My 5th trimmer just died. I  wont be exchanging it for a 6th one. I am done. I was gentle with the trimmer, only used it on my face once or twice a week, let it dry when not using, and even covered the charge port with black electrical tape to stop water from entering. I noticed from my first two that the electrical contacts would get all cruddy and rusted up, preventing a good electrical contact enough to charge. This ""trimmer"" is pure garbage IMO. I warned you!"
4/23/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	As advertised. Would buy agsin
4/25/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	GREAT!
4/25/2016	Amazon	2	bad!	"The battery died after 20 days or so, bad !"
4/25/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"good product, good battery life"
4/27/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	use it on regular basis
4/28/2016	Amazon	5	"This was an excellent buy, and much better than I expected it would be.  100% happy."	"It's great.  The shaver on it doesn't work that great.  And I haven't tried the nose hair trimmer yet.  But the clippers work great.  The battery life is great.  The attachments are great.  It's lightweight, small, quality-made.  Excellent buy.  I'm 100% happy with it.  And I am now a supporter of Remington products, and this was the only Remington product I've ever used.  The shaver does work.  It just takes a long time.  I'm not big on shaving, so whatever.  I have always just used clippers to get rid of my facial hair.  I don't know what else to say really.  It's just 100%.  Better than I expected from the reviews.  Some of the reviews said it feels cheap.  It does not feel cheap at all. Lightweight, but definitely quality, sturdy, well made construction.  Cheers to Remington.  Great product at a very competitive price.  100% recommend this product.  Cheers."
4/28/2016	Amazon	4	Great	This product held up to Remington's reputation.Great value
4/28/2016	Amazon	5	FIVE STARS	Great Product. I liked the small pouch that comes with this trimmer. So thoughtful!
4/28/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Love it! It is strong and not weak like most other brands
5/1/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	good so far...
5/1/2016	Amazon	5	Great battery life	Best part of the razor is it lasts for more than a week without recharging.
5/3/2016	Amazon	5	Excellent Buy	"With the Lithium battery, seems to run forever before needing a charge.  Very reasonably priced and has a lot of accessories."
5/4/2016	Amazon	2	Two Stars	Doesn't shave as easy as I thought it would
5/5/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	have had same trimmer brand for 4 years good price
5/5/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Re-purchase of a great classic. Fresh (new) batteries make a world of difference.
5/5/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	always chat and long lasting
5/5/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Good product at fair price
5/5/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great!
5/7/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Excelent
5/7/2016	Amazon	2	Size	In the ad you see it bigger than it really is
5/7/2016	Amazon	3	but working fine.	"Cheap, but working fine."
5/7/2016	Amazon	1	Not worth taking home!	"I bought the PG6020 after losing a Wahl at a motel while traveling. I needed a trimmer, so te idea of multiple heads seemed like a good one. It did not trim as well as the Wahl and seemed to need charging more often. After a few weeks I got tired of charging every 10 days or so and did not like the trim so I got a new Wahl and kept the Remington for its small trimmer. Now after two years of owning both my Wahl still holds a charge for up to three weeks and the Remington needs charging before ever use. By 24 hours it has lost its charge."
5/9/2016	Amazon	5	yes indeed	so far so good--used on private parts without injury...
5/9/2016	Amazon	5	Good quality	Excellent trimmer for the price.
5/10/2016	Amazon	5	"Some other may not think so, but it's the best bang for your buck"	"Some of the more tech-savvy people may turn their noses up to this but it's perfect for the price. The detachable parts have a cheap-y feeling to them, but they work perfectly. So far so good, this product has everything I needed."
5/15/2016	Amazon	5	Good	This shaver rocks
5/15/2016	Amazon	5	Remington Trimmer	Works well.
5/15/2016	Amazon	5	perfect!	"Best trimmer I've tried. Love the adjustble guard, just the right length i was looking for"
5/17/2016	Amazon	4	Great product and well worth the money	"Very good quality and is easy to use. The attachments included work great except for the nose trimmer. That's more of a personal hit or miss in terms of how well it'll work for you. Using it for about 5 minutes every other day, it'll last you at least 10 uses before you need to recharge with the included charger.  In terms of ""personal"" trimming, be very careful around that area as the blades can clip into your skin. Take your time and be very careful."
5/19/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	my boyfriend loves it!!!!!!
5/21/2016	Amazon	5	"well designed and good materials, totally worth every penny"	"Very cheap and handy,well designed and good materials, totally worth every penny."
5/21/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	as I expected works good
5/21/2016	Amazon	2	"The new Remington functioned pretty well, but after only two years it stopped ..."	"As we so often find, they just don't make things the way they used to.  I bought this product when our 22-year-old Oster trimmer finally gave out.  The new Remington functioned pretty well, but after only two years it stopped working altogether.  I don't think it a failed rechargeable  battery, as they typically show their age with shorter-lasting charges before quitting. Considering the limited use I gave it, I would have expected it to hold up better . . ."
5/22/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Best timer I have owned
5/23/2016	Amazon	5	Best one I've used in 20 years of beard grooming	Tried multiple beard trimmers and had given up. A friend convinced me to try this one and it actually works. Best one I've used in 20 years of beard grooming.
5/24/2016	Amazon	5	Good trimmer	Works great. Plenty of attachments to do all your trimming.  I like the bag to keep it all together.
5/24/2016	Amazon	1	company ignores your email about warranty and batter fail after a year	"item after a year of use now after a full charge can run about 30 seconds only. Does not do a good job. Contacted manufacture, which for a long time does not reply me. I think they hope to save the trouble of processing warranty. Very disgusting service and untrustworthy product.  Update: I have contacted them twice in a month, never reply, did not help me with my warranty."
5/29/2016	Amazon	5	Great product	Works fine
5/29/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	I like the Remington brand.
5/29/2016	Amazon	2	"Nice, for a couple months."	Good product only for a couple months. Battery life is the worst. I have to charge the battery for 24 hours and leave it plugged in to use it. The parts rusted after 6 months and the guards all broke from regular use.
5/30/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	perfect.
5/30/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Works good. Blades are decent quality. Battery life long.
6/1/2016	Amazon	1	Will not buy again.	First month i used it I would rate it ok at best. Takes about twice as long to shave as my last cordless. Then the next month the on/off button does not always work and takes a bit of jiggeling to get the power on. It runs like its only partially charged and under powered.  Maybe i just got a lemon but will not buy again to find out.
6/5/2016	Amazon	1	This trimmer is garbage	Battery does not last long. Used a handful of time before It died and had to throw out. This trimmer is garbage
6/7/2016	Amazon	5	Best trimmers ive owned	"Don't know who some of these reviewers are but they are becoming so untrustworthy or maybe this is actually their opinion of this product but with my true experience with these trimmers has been nothing least than extraordinary. I charged them fully and it holds so long that I forget they have a charger and it get to be used often... ( charger sits around like a Maytag repair guy!!!  ) lol . And to speak on their cutting power ,they are amazing. Had no issues with them cutting anything I put in front of them . So if you want a dependable pair of trimmers searching because you've found them... thanks for reading my post."
6/9/2016	Amazon	1	Bought 2 - Both Died	"I purchased one, used it for a week and it worked well.  I purchased another for my son and it worked well - for 2 weeks and died, refusing to charge though charger was fine.  A week later, other unit also quit.  Terrible item, I suggest buying another brand."
6/9/2016	Amazon	1	Garbage	"Garbage, won't hold a charge, not enough strength to get through a thick chin... Updated. Completely dead, lights up when on charging but won't make a sound off charger, save your money for a real razor"
6/10/2016	Amazon	3	Three Stars	It nicks and pulls hair sometimes
6/11/2016	Amazon	1	Product was delivered 45 days ago and has already stopped ...	"Product was delivered 45 days ago and has already stopped working properly. After a full nights charge, the trimmer will only operate for about 15 seconds before turning itself off."
6/11/2016	Amazon	1	One Star	Overheats really fast.
6/12/2016	Amazon	5	"Wonderful compact, cordless groomer!"	"Fabulous groomer, trimmer! I bought one for my ex, when he left I purchased one for myself, I liked it so much."
6/13/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great traveler charger. Keeps battery charge. Highly recommended!
6/14/2016	Amazon	5	I use this on my s***	"This one's great for light trimming around the base of the shaft and edge of the sack. It will still get you if you're not careful, but if you are, this one works. I've had some before that just wouldn't work. I'm talking 10 - 15 knicks on my dong that burned when exposed to the juice, so far, only one knick with this one. I wouldn't go for the whole sack though with it. G-UNIT"
6/15/2016	Amazon	4	Good But Not For Close Shave	I like this so far for the most part.  It is quiet and the trimmer works very well.  The attachment that is supposed to cut the hair close to the skin with the foil on it doesn't work so well.  I have to go over the same spot many times in several directions to get a somewhat close shave.
6/15/2016	Amazon	5	great battery life	"High quality electric razor with a ton of addons, great battery life, and sleek look. It's a steal at it's current price."
6/15/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Yes 100 %
6/16/2016	Amazon	4	Have been using this for over 6 months. I've ...	"Have been using this for over 6 months.  I've had no problems with it, and have only charged it twice."
6/16/2016	Amazon	5	I'm very pleased with this product and it works great	I'm very pleased with this product and it works great. With the different head sizes I'm now able to trim my own sideburns and mustache as I want. You won't go wrong with this product.
6/19/2016	Amazon	1	Debilitating batter issues	"I would avoid this product. I purchased a brand new unit and immediately battery life was an issue. Not only did the trimmer require me to charge for at least several consecutive hours before use, I also needed to keep the unit plugged in while I trimmed or it would hardly keep a charge longer than one minute. If I say, charged the trimmer for several hours, then removed the charger and left it off overnight, the unit would barely give a faint buzz before unceremoniously turning off when used next. After suffering through this for about a year, the unit finally just stopped working entirely. Very disappointing!"
6/20/2016	Amazon	4	Can't Go Wrong!	Works well and is very very convenient. Expected it to cost much more.
6/20/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great product for the price
6/21/2016	Amazon	5	I just love this little thing	battery lasts forever! I just love this little thing!
6/22/2016	Amazon	4	A great buy for this price range	"A great buy for this price range,lots of attachments,battery last long. The only thing that I didn't like was the charging light because there is no indicator whether the battery is fully charged or not."
6/22/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Very good
6/22/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Very good
6/23/2016	Amazon	1	Likely to fail; trimmed fine when working.	"I didn't purchase this through Amazon, but it is a terrible product. Worked fine exactly twice...then ceased to function entirely with no warning. Took it apart to diagnose the problem...battery was dead. Parts used were cheapest available and overall construction quality is poor. Wouldn't recommend even for the low price."
6/24/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	??
6/24/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Works wonders. Buzz cuts and shaving, it does it well without cuts and what not. Battery lasts really long"
6/24/2016	Amazon	5	My primary shaver	Great! Any guy or girl i guess can shave any region of hair they need to on their body.
6/25/2016	Amazon	5	Good buy	"Had it a couple of months and have only charged it once. Only use it every couple of weeks, but it seems to be holding a charge very well. The attachments fit well and it cuts well. No complaints."
6/25/2016	Amazon	5	Brother approved!	Bought this for my brother as a gift. He loves it! Couldn't be happier with this purchased.
6/25/2016	Amazon	5	I liked this shaver/clipper	"I liked this shaver/clipper.  Runs quite a while on one charge.  I haven't used the shaving attachment, so I don't know how well it works. Small and compact, comes with a pull string bag."
6/25/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Arrived pretty early and I love all the parts to it, really good tool for good price, 9.11/10"
6/26/2016	Amazon	5	Best Choice of its Kind	"Simple and fast tool changing system. Noise level is low and very tolerable that it does not distract you from what you're doing. I absolutely love this product I actually purchased from Kohls. However, I wish it included a portable carrying case."
6/26/2016	Amazon	5	My Second	"My last one died after a couple of years, so I bought another one just like it. The others as described didn't seem as easy to adjust as far as the height is concerned, and this one has a wide range of heights. It's great for hair and beard."
6/27/2016	Amazon	1	I had this less than a year before the battery ...	I had this less than a year before the battery started to go. I would charge it overnight and it would barley get through 2 min. of trimming. Now it wont hold a charge at all.
6/28/2016	Amazon	2	Disapointed	Not easy to change or adjust head.very poor written instructions . Would not recommend .
6/29/2016	Amazon	2	Two Stars	Used this thing twice and the motor never worked again. You get what you pay for.
7/1/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	I loved this item.
7/1/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Amazing razor, hands down the best razor to use below the waist."
7/1/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Product just as described
7/1/2016	Amazon	5	Replaced old one I loved	"So, I had my last Remington trim shaver kit for like 15 years. It is still going strong to this day and I absolutely loved it and do love it.  It's one of my lifetime favorite items.  I decided to gift my old one to my oldest son and buy myself a new one- this one.  Overall, I really like this one. I would say the eyebrow vertical trimmer is a nice piece that my old one didn't have.  I don't really have any complaints about this kit- other than one.  The ""holder,"" or thing that sits on your sink counter and holds all the pieces in it, is a design I don't really care for.  It doesn't really hold the pieces securely and everything knocks around.  My old one had a holder that kept the razor in a vertical position and all the attachments sat around it in a secure manner, with a lid.  If it wasn't for the holder- I would rate it a 5.  As it is, I would rate it a 4.25, so I'm rounding down to 4."
7/2/2016	Amazon	5	BRILLIANT	Works so well. Whisper quiet and cuts clean and sharp and perfect.
7/3/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	I love lithium batteries.  They charge fast and hold their charge.
7/3/2016	Amazon	5	Great quality	"Trims cleanly, cleans easily, holds a great charge."
7/4/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	"Does the job it was designed for very well without a lot of ""charging"" nonsense."
7/6/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	awesome shaves...everytime
7/7/2016	Amazon	5	Great all in 1 shaver	Works great with only 1 complaint.  I wish it came with a better base to hold all shaver and all the attachments.  The one included works but could be better.  It shaves and trims great and cleanup is also easy.
7/7/2016	Amazon	5	Love it	"Portable, Smooth and nice. I love this product."
7/9/2016	Amazon	1	sometimes it goes so slow like it's basically dying	"The speed of which it operates constantly fluctuates, sometimes it goes so slow like it's basically dying.  It does this on a full charge, low charge or even when plugged in.  Unit is cleaned and maintained properly, pretty much a trash product.  Spend 20$ more and get something that'll last you."
7/10/2016	Amazon	1	Stopped working on day...	This product inexplicably stopped working one day. I would not recommend it; it's worth putting in the extra money for something that will last significantly longer. I ended up buying the dual ended Phillips body groomer and have been happy with it so far.
7/10/2016	Amazon	5	Very happy with this shaver!	"Excellent product, delivered on time."
7/11/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"this is one of those things that works much better than expected, really is a good clipper"
7/12/2016	Amazon	3	Three Stars	very convenient. worth it
7/12/2016	Amazon	3	Three Stars	"Good, but battery finishes pretty quickly."
7/13/2016	Amazon	5	He loved it and his girlfriend thank me as well	I got tired of my grandkid's shaggy beard. He loved it and his girlfriend thank me as well!!!
7/13/2016	Amazon	1	Piece of junk	"Worked well at first, but quickly quit holding a charge. Unusable junk."
7/14/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works very well on my beard and mustache
7/14/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	I did like it
7/14/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great shaver for the price.  My boyfriend love it!
7/14/2016	Amazon	5	Just what he needed	perfect Father's Day gift for my husband!
7/15/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	trims hair quickly.very thorough.
7/15/2016	Amazon	4	great but I feel like it could be a closer ...	great but I feel like it could be a closer cut. Some times it takes a couple goes at an area. other then that it feels comfortable and runs great.
7/16/2016	Amazon	5	A worthy replacement for the previous version	"I bought this as a replacement for the PG 6020 model that i had that lost its ability to charge. This model uses a different recharging technology (lithium ion as opposed to NiCad in the prior) so hopefully this will last longer. Out of the package the product comes with the main grooming head, a shaving head, an eyebrow/ear hair trimmer head, and an adjustable comb attachment, and two comb attachments that I can't figure out how to use for the main head. Also includes the charging cable and a storage/travel bag. Missing (by design) in the new version is the detailer head that was included in the older product. Overall, I am very happy with the product."
7/16/2016	Amazon	5	He's happy with this purchase and so am I	"Purchased for my husband, charged up fast and removed his hair even faster.  He was done shaving and trimming his facial hair within minutes.  He's happy with this purchase and so am I :)"
7/17/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Perfect
7/18/2016	Amazon	5	Great overall head to toe body hair trimmer with lots of useful attachments	"I bought these as a general body hair trimmer and not for the beard so am reviewing based on use in all other areas needing a trim.  I had a cheap Wahl previously and it lasted less than a year.  This Remington is much better built, yet is still compact and lightweight.  It just has the feel of something that will not fall apart.  It comes with a bunch of attachments, which pop on/off the head fitting very easily.  Some won't be of much use to me, such as the foil and the comb attachments, but the rest will be of value.  For beard trimming though, there are three different combs/lengths.  Most beard trimmers have about 10 settings, so three would be a little sparse.  Actually, I use the ""bare head"" as shown in the picture the most.  It will ""shave"" the hair down to the skin line, and so far I have had no problems with it pulling or nicking the skin and I've used it in some pretty sensitive areas.  But I'm being very careful as well.  The battery is rated to last over three hours of use, which will come in handy when I travel internationally since their is no 220 voltage converter built in, as there is on most every electronic device these days.  It is strictly 120V, so if you take it oversees, you'll need a converter.  But for me, three hours plus should be sufficient on one charge for a three week trip."
7/19/2016	Amazon	5	"Great product, great price!"	"I had been using typical hair clippers for all my male grooming needs, but didn't really like the experience. I would have to plug it in and the cord was always getting in the way. It was cumbersome to hold and use with my left hand. So I decided to try this smaller cordless device. I have to say I'm really impressed. It trims very close to the scalp and the blades are quite sharp. The fact that it is cordless is very convenient and it is very light as well. The charge lasts a very long time so you can take it places that doesn't have electricity for an extended period of time. Another nice feature is that it's very easy to change the head for multiple uses such as nose hair trimmer and beard trimmer. I mostly use it to shave my head, but it's nice to have the other functionality. Another nice feature is that you don't have to apply oil to it before and after every time you use it. In fact, it doesn't even come with oil. They do recommend to apply a little bit of oil every once in a while, but I haven't and it has worked great so far. I highly recommend this trimmer! Great quality and functionality for a relatively low price."
7/20/2016	Amazon	4	Handy little kit with a reasonable price	"This is a handy little grooming kit. I bought this for my husband, and he likes it well enough. The price is reasonable, and the kit works well. My husband mentioned that the narrow attachment and ear cleaner aren't useful and don't work very well. It does a hold a charge a fairly long time, but oddly, and I don't know if this is a weird glitch just with ours, it won't turn on when it's plugged in charging. Seems a little weird. I don't think we've ever taken this kit with us on a trip, but it looks like it would be great for travel, as it comes with the nice little storage pouch."
7/20/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Hubby loves it!
7/21/2016	Amazon	1	"I bought this razor in November 2015, barely used ..."	"I bought this razor in November 2015, barely used it, and it's no longer functioning as of July 2016. Their warranty is absurd, you need to ship the product back with the original receipt; this is not only cost prohibitive (shipping would cost half of what the item originally cost) but saving the original receipt seems ridiculous considering there is record of the purchase on Amazon."
7/23/2016	Amazon	5	It did the job before and still doing it now	"This was my third one and it continues to do the job. The first one I had lasted about two years.  The attachments is good enough for what I use it for, mostly for trimming my mustache.  It is easy to remove the attachments with just a twist and clean them.  The only thing I would say is missing is a brush to brush off the hair that gets in, sometimes the water does not get everything out."
7/23/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Works well for trimming mustache and eye brows
7/23/2016	Amazon	2	Two Stars	"Within less than 2 years, the battery life has decreased to nothing. Would not buy ever again."
7/24/2016	Amazon	5	so good. Tried two attachments and they work well	"So far, so good. Tried two attachments and they work well."
7/24/2016	Amazon	2	Not the best	I use this to man-scape and this razor chews rather then cuts... If you know what I mean...
7/24/2016	Amazon	3	Three Stars	Won't work while plugged in. Lame
7/25/2016	Amazon	5	Good for men and women. Great for the price!	"Very precise. Has many attachments. Powerful. Great for small areas and cuts through thick hair well. Good for details, too!"
7/25/2016	Amazon	5	"Great, light weight trimmer!"	"I am so happy that I finally ordered this trimmer! After being charged up, it lasts for many uses. It is perfect for trimming around the ears and at the base of the neck. I have even used it on my own hair and have been able to successfully trim up the length in the back...something that I had a lot of trouble doing with the regular size hair cutter. I love how light weight it is too! Would definitely recommend this to anyone, especially those that are the hair stylists for family members!"
7/25/2016	Amazon	4	Men's trimmer	Great value
7/27/2016	Amazon	3	... and takes longer to shave but is not a bad product.	cutting head is small and takes longer to shave but is not a bad product.
7/28/2016	Amazon	3	He was disappointed this model has a bad design	"Husband had an older model decided to upgrade for him. He was disappointed this model has a bad design, will not stay on charge stand and attachments will not all fit in the stand where they supposedly go."
7/29/2016	Amazon	3	Nah	Doesn't come charged :(
7/29/2016	Amazon	5	Great groomer	"I was suspicious that this would be a low quality product, but I am quite happy with the performance and quality of this groomer. Had a more expensive Phillips that just didn't last and the Remington is a much better unit------and half the price!"
7/30/2016	Amazon	2	Two Stars	The battery doesn't last long at all.  I need one that you can just plug in and use.
7/31/2016	Amazon	2	Two Stars	quit working after about 10 shaves
8/1/2016	Amazon	5	love it	my son loves this...and I love that he actually shaves!
8/3/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great gift!
8/3/2016	Amazon	1	Stop charging in less than a month	It was great and all until it stopped charging which is less than a month after purchase. Watch out for this product.
8/4/2016	Amazon	1	This is disgusting.	I received a used groomer with somebody's hairs on it. This is disgusting.
8/5/2016	Amazon	2	Had a good run with it tho	Broke down after a year. Won't charge anymore. Had a good run with it tho.
8/6/2016	Amazon	4	My first experience of using this product was perfect. But I still need to use it more ...	My first experience of using this product was perfect. But I still need to use it more to find out it's performance.
8/7/2016	Amazon	1	Not sure what happened other than it stopped holding a charge after 2 months.	Do not know what happened but as I had it like 2 months and went with me traveling overseas it stopped taking a charge.  Maybe a surge happened between the adapter and my plug but still some reason it just stopped working and that sucked.
8/7/2016	Amazon	5	Good product	Does exactly what it claims to do and does it well.
8/7/2016	Amazon	5	... a year and it works so well still it perfect for a quick clean shave	Ive had this product for almost a year and it works so well still it perfect for a quick clean shave.
8/8/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works perfect
8/8/2016	Amazon	1	1/2  Stars	it stopped working after 2 months....WHAT A JOKE!!!!!
8/8/2016	Amazon	4	Does the Job	I like this Trimmer and it is pretty efficient. Only which I knew how to use some of the attachments.  There is an assumption by the manufacturer that if you but this product you know how to use all the attachments.  Well I can cut the hair growing over my ears but it would have been nice to have had included a little instruction book.
8/8/2016	Amazon	5	Overall nice little shaver at a good price	"So far so good, I bought this product about 2 months ago and use it 3X a week, I decided to recharge it today for the first time. It makes less noise than my previous shaver, it is lightweight, many good functions (except maybe the foil shaver which is very small). I have not used it for hair ... maybe one day. Overall nice little shaver at a good price, I just hope the battery will last longer than mentioned on some reviews, I have tried it with the cord plugged in and it works while plugged contrarely to some reviews where it is mentioned that it does not work while plugged in."
8/9/2016	Amazon	3	"Not Really Worth It, Overall..."	"I didnt buy this thru Amazon or receive thru Vine program, but received it as a test and review thru Opinion Bar Research, an on-line survey site. I thought after using it for 3 weeks that I would see if I could find this product online and see if the reviews there jibed with my thoughts and experiences. Of course, I found it here on Amazon.com The good: the main razor head is very good, very sharp, very comfy. The razor is easy to use and feels good in my hand, is easy to control and is fast. The variable setting attachment is very nice and cuts my hair very evenly and doesnt clog very easily, even with longer hair.  It's not very noisy nor is the vibration disturbing. It is easy to clean and maintain. The bad: the other attachments are useless. The foil shaver cant cut anything, the nose/ear trimmer kinda cuts ear hair but doesnt do a thing for nasal hair. They need shaper blades or faster speed. I havent used the clip on combs, so I have no opinion on them. I havent had to charge it yet, so that is kind of a good thing, as the charge lasts a long time. I've used it on 6 or 7 different occasions; I would have probably used it more but for the poor performing attachments. Unfortunately, I have to send it back when my test period ends so I cant experience whether it will have charging issues in the future. Overall, it's ok, even great, if you just use the razor head, otherwise, its really useless. If I bought this I would have returned it for the poor performance of the other attachments, and now that I see it may have charging issues after a relatively short period of time, I doubt I would buy it at all, I'd find another solution."
8/10/2016	Amazon	5	Great value	Got it for my nephew and he loves it and uses it almost daily.
8/11/2016	Amazon	4	Good for the price	"Other than a battery that takes too long to charge and does not last more than a couple of uses, this product has performed as expected. I have used several different brands, and I am hopeful this one lasts more than a year!"
8/11/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Powerful and much better than my old Remington, which lasted many years."
8/12/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	worked great for my needs
8/13/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Very happy with this product.  Great battery, great price, does the job for facial and body hair."

8/15/2016	Amazon	5	Great for a personal trimmer	Great for a personal trimmer
8/16/2016	Amazon	2	Battery life and blade width	"This shaver lasted for just 2 months before the lithium battery died and would not take a charge. Would cost me more than what the shaver is worth to send it back for refund.  Also, on ALL shavers and beard trimmers the description should clearly show - directly beneath the product image - the actual dimension of the blade and attachments. This is very significant. This Blade width is 1 1/8 inches wide Foil shaver is 3/4 inch This is very narrow and cumbersome to shave with. Had I known how narrow the blade and attachments were I would not have bought this shaver"
8/17/2016	Amazon	5	"But finally I got this one and couldn't be happier, I could almost shave my head if I ..."	"I've been looking for a strong but compact razor for a long time. Since one my dad gave me years ago died, I was never able to find another as strong. But finally I got this one and couldn't be happier, I could almost shave my head if I wanted to. I haven't had it very long so it still has to pass the test of time, but it is 5 stars in all other areas."
8/19/2016	Amazon	4	Get what you pay for...	You get what you pay for! This worked fine for what I payed for it but I can't help but feel like I should have waited and saved money for something nicer! Almost all of the attachments have broken because of the quality of the plastic but it still works so there's that...
8/20/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	It used to overheat.
8/21/2016	Amazon	2	The trimmer itself is good but the adjustable attachment	"The trimmer itself  is good but the adjustable attachment, which I need the most, has had almost all of the plastic dividers break off so the most important attachment is now useless because all it does is shave me at a 1 or 2 setting."
8/21/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Excellent product, works extremely well and meets my needs."
8/21/2016	Amazon	5	Batteryy	Works well.. Great thing about this is battery!
8/22/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	goood
8/22/2016	Amazon	4	Nice little groomer for the money	"Nice little groomer for the money. I was first surprised at how well the foil attachment worked (had very small hopes and was pleasantly surprised). The body groomer does a good job for trimming down any areas you wish to do so. I am able to get a reasonable amount of detail around beard area, and the battery seems to last a very good while before needing a recharge. Only criticism is I wished all the various attachments locked into their spaces in the holder. This would have been a five star review if they had. It does get a bit irritating to pick something up only to see the rest fall hither and yon. Still, only a small irritant."
8/23/2016	Amazon	5	Great	"I cut my hair, trim and shave with this, and trim body hair"
8/23/2016	Amazon	5	Wow.	Awesome. It came with quite a lot of attachments. I like it.
8/25/2016	Amazon	2	Two Stars	This is really weak and so small.  Barely able to deal with a light beard.
8/26/2016	Amazon	5	Would be great if you could continue to shave with it plugged ...	"Had one that never held a charge, this one works as it is supposed to, stays charged threw grooming.  Would be great if you could continue to shave with it plugged in after battery goes but no such lick"
8/27/2016	Amazon	5	Works great for tiny puppy feet! :o)	"I got this to groom my chihuahua's feet. My old one was falling apart and I broke down to try this. Had to use it a few times to say yay or nay...definitely yay. I love the fact that it's lithium, holds a charge and I don't have to keep replacing batteries that don't last long. You may not want it for the same purpose, but for the price it comes with lots of attachments (that I won't be using most more than likely) for obvious reasons, a pouch to hold everything in and the charging cable. It's well made, easy to use and shows you when it's fully charged. It even had a little charge on it when it arrived so that I could be sure that it worked. Well worth my investment!"
8/28/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Excellent product!
8/28/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Given as a gift to my son and he loves this item does that it works great
8/29/2016	Amazon	5	I like it a lot	"This trimmer replaced an identical unit that I bought about 3 years ago, only because the batteries failed.  I like it a lot.  It trims well.  The two heads and other attachments work perfectly.  I haven't been able to find anything else better since the old one failed.  Great price too."
8/29/2016	Amazon	4	... start using it yet but so far it looks good plus packaging comes with a nice little draw string ...	Haven't even start using it yet but so far it looks good plus packaging comes with a nice little draw string bag for travel or to just keep safe and in one place.
8/30/2016	Amazon	2	Battery Died Only After Two Weeks	"This could have been just the product I personally received, however, the problem still stands. The product worked perfectly for the first two-ish weeks of using it. It was actually a really great product. However, after using it, I needed to recharge the batteries. I plugged it in to charge it, left it for a couple of hours, and it still wouldn't work. I checked the plug to see if there was any electricity running through it, and it was not the plug. The battery on the product completely died. I do understand that this isn't a likely issue, however, I have seen a few other reviews similar to this. Just keep in mind that this could happen when you are buying this product."
8/30/2016	Amazon	5	works great	works great for me
8/31/2016	Amazon	5	"Sharp, inexpensive and an all inclusive hair care system."	"Excellent price and the unit does everything I need it to do, and is nice and sharp."
9/1/2016	Amazon	1	One Star	"Stopped working in 6 months, with rare use. Product does not charge anymore."
9/3/2016	Amazon	4	Nice shaver	"Really like this, works well, charges quickly, attachments are easy to use. Only thing is that I wish it came with a cleaning brush or cleaning instructions!"
9/3/2016	Amazon	5	Great product for cheap price	Inexpensive and works well. I have not experienced any pulling or cutting.
9/4/2016	Amazon	5	good buy	"Husband loves this thing, good buy"
9/5/2016	Amazon	4	Great Cheap Razor	"This shaver has been great! I'd start off by posting a picture but it looks just like the stock photo. This shaver has done exactly what I need.  CON There seems to be a problem with power surges which is always very disappointing. Randomly, plugged in or not, the razor will have its moments of glory and moments where it slows down but is still useable. Careful not to overcharge.  PRO I was looking for a cheap electric trimmer razor that comes with various shave lengths that is quick and that I can have plugged in while using for the emergency ""my shaver is out of battery but I need to go to the beach or pool right now and my entire torso is extremely hairy and coarse because I'm Italian"" scenario. Sometimes I like my torso trimmed and sometimes I like it clean shaven so I'll razor shave it afterwards but this guy definitely does what I wanted it to."
9/5/2016	Amazon	3	They can break easily.	works fairly well.  this is my 2nd one.  be care full using it.  They can break easily.
9/5/2016	Amazon	1	This product stopped working after 2 months. I contacted ...	"This product stopped working after 2 months. I contacted the mfg. and they wanted me to disassemble it for a lot number. I had to purchase a very small screwdriver kit to get the head off and then there were no numbers I could find. So I sent them a message telling them I was done, and proceeded to purchase a different product that works well. Dont purchase this product if you want my opinion."
9/5/2016	Amazon	5	Working well so far	"Only used one  trimmer so far, the one for body hair.  Worked fine, better than my sideburn trimmer I had used previously.  Good for prep for medical procedures.  Like the lithium battery.  Good price."
9/6/2016	Amazon	3	Three Stars	bad quality
9/6/2016	Amazon	4	The Perfect Grooming Kit	"This is one of my favorite grooming tools. Small, compact and all the correct attachments. You could not ask for anything else."
9/6/2016	Amazon	1	"Weak groomer, battery already dead less than a year later."	"My wife got this for me maybe a year ago. The battery on this is already dead, and didn't hold a charge very long even after it was charged. It replaced another groomer I had that had served me well for years but had reached the end of its life. This thing was a disappointment from day one. The attachments were fine, but it was weaker and lost charge very quickly."
9/6/2016	Amazon	5	Awesome Grooming Tool!!	i love the fact that you can adjust the clip to different levels.Battery last a long time without having to charge it again.
9/6/2016	Amazon	5	A must have	"The best one I ever have got. Works great.  James Dean Martin Stockton, California   95201"

9/19/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Good quality. Attachments are easy to use.
9/20/2016	Amazon	1	Worked good until it broke after only about a month of personal use. Purchase something better and more realiable.	"Scroll down for review summery. I have tried many portable trimmers over the years. Either at home or when I am traveling. I use them mainly to trim my mustache, sideburns, and line up the back of my hair. Although, they usually work ok for this (don't have the power of a plug-in model) it is the convenience that makes me continue to use them. Biggest gripe I always had was the poor runtime and failing batteries. I literally have a box filled with broken remington trimmers. I had completely given up on them and for the last few years I switched to using a plug in andis t-outliner. Recently I saw the remington pg6025 at walmart and noticed they were using a lithium cell finally, so I thought I would give it a shot. Turns out it was exactly what I needed. Battery life was really good. I could cut as much as I wanted and it wouldn't die or power down. I travelled recently and loved having it with me. But this ended after just a couple of uses. Now it has stopped working. It won't take a charge and it left me with a hitler looking mustache the other day. My advice dont waste your money on any remington cordless trimmer they are not good quality and will end up breaking when you need them most.  Highlights: When it worked it worked really good. It won't cut through super thick hair. Battery life is very good. But unit broke after just a handful of uses. Stay away from these cordless trimmers, they don't last and will leave you disappointed."
9/20/2016	Amazon	5	Amazing	Perfect for beard and great trimmer for the price ??
9/21/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	I strongly recommend the set! It's much better than Philips Norelco.

9/22/2016	Amazon	5	"The battery life is excellent, and the cutting options are numerous"	"Outstanding product!  I've been using this for a few months now.  The battery life is excellent, and the cutting options are numerous.  The blades are noticeably more sharp than other clippers I've owned.  It's lightweight also. I've used it for arms, legs, chest, etc.  It's much more efficient in cutting than other products also.  I will and would buy this product again."

9/24/2016	Amazon	5	This product works great. Charged it for 5 hours prior to use	"This product works great. Charged it for 5 hours prior to use, put the # 1 on and did some men's grooming on myself for my wife. VERY close shave, no worries of nicks at all, cuts body hair like butter, trimmed down sensitive areas in less than a minute - very safe and efficient product. Highly recommend. I have used a bunch of other models, Wahl etc - this one is a keeper."
9/25/2016	Amazon	2	Not really happy with this product	"Not really happy with this product.  When all attachments are removed, don't feel it gets as close at trimming and shaping as other similarly priced combo shavers/trimmers.  Will replace when I save up a little to make a purchase."
9/25/2016	Amazon	3	Its okay	"It's okay, seems to work well. It does feel like cheap plastic. Should have spent an extra $10 and gotten a metal casing from a different brand"
9/26/2016	Amazon	4	Cuttin' the cost not shaving the quality	"I have owned the remington groomers before, but this time upgraded to the multiple attachment bundle. The razor bade jeeps a good charge long enough to trim, cut, and contour shape without running weak, dead, or sluggish. All of the attachments work well with the exception of the shaver head which seems to have a weak mesh face to it. Overall very satisfied and continuing to use. Great priduct and great price."

9/29/2016	Amazon	1	"Nonstandard, non-compatible charger"	"Doesn't use a (standard) USB plug, and the power brick they include only works at 110V.  Why, in the year 2016, they'd still be using a proprietary charger is beyond me, but if you're going to sell something as ""great for travel,"" at least make it capable of travel.  (Every single other piece of electronics I carry has managed to adopt the extremely widespead & accepted USB standard: cameras, phone, tablet, UV water filter, GPS logger, powerbank, mini wifi router, & headlamp.  There's just no reason this device should require its own separate brick.)"

10/2/2016	Amazon	5	Great product	"works very well for my husband,he doesn't mind grooming so much with the proper tools!"
10/3/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	I like it. It is what they say. Would def. recommend it.
10/3/2016	Amazon	5	Finally a slot for my hairdryer!	"My husband purchased this. He had received one for Christmas as a gift, less than two years ago, but it wouldn't hold a charge unless he kept it on the charger 24x7. Unfortunately, our bathroom has one outlet, with 2 plugs. So that didn't work too well. Considering not only does he have to charge his mustache trimmer, he also has a beard trimmer, and his electronic toothbrush (which also has to charge 24x7). Of course, leaving me no plug to plug in my hairdryer. Now he only charges his new purchase maybe once a week, so I get to plug in my hairdryer!"
10/3/2016	Amazon	2	battery maybe dead	"This is a good shaver when it works.  It turned on when I received it.  Afterwards it would only turn on when I had the charging cable plugged in.  I charged it for two days and still same, it would run with out the cable.  I sent it back."
10/3/2016	Amazon	5	One of the best purchased I've made	One of the best purchased I've made. Great for trimming facial hair or to use as a body groomer.
10/3/2016	Amazon	5	Nice and quiet too	Works perfectly. Nice and quiet too.
10/4/2016	Amazon	3	Everything else seems good. Long battery	Not crazy on the hair clippers. Everything else seems good. Long battery life
10/5/2016	Amazon	4	MERM 44	It work very well and has good attachments
10/5/2016	Amazon	3	Let down	"This is a good set but has one flaw. When using the trimmer with no attachments the trimmer head gets extremely hot and unusable. I use this trimmer to line my facial hair and front/back lines 99% of the time. I have no use for the attachments at all and am fairly certain this problem would not affect people who use the attachments. I am very disappointed with this one flaw because otherwise it is a great trimmer that cuts close. All other aspects of this trimmer are top notch, hence why I am still giving it 3/5 stars. I could have just been unlucky and got a defective trimmer but I'm just telling it like it is. Hope this helps."
10/5/2016	Amazon	1	NOT Android Charger	Not android charger compatible. It has a cheap round charger port.
10/5/2016	Amazon	4	It's not the best or the worst	"It's not the best or the worst. It definitely does the job so there are ""few"" complaints, but I am mostly a fan of the redesign. The last time I bought a Remington Titanium was almost 8 years ago and the guard was on a different slide-and-lock system. This is way easier to use and clean. It's just not the best choice of device if you are attempting to mow down longer hair on the shortest setting."
10/5/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	received
10/6/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great and inexpensive!
10/6/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great little product and it works well for me.
10/6/2016	Amazon	5	Great trimmer.	This trimmer works great.
10/6/2016	Amazon	4	Quality product for the price	"Works really well and I'm very happy with it, has a lot of features the bag is nice and the charts last a long time. I would recommend this product"
10/7/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	So far so good. Brother had one loved it. Battery life doesnt last long after several months tho...
10/7/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Still going strong a couple years later. No problems so far.
10/7/2016	Amazon	1	Piece of crap	"Guys if you expect to shave your face before work it's useless. Took me half an hour. This thing is a toy, it's crap. And the tray they give you won't hold the attachments at all they fall out.  It's not worth 5 bucks. Get a Norelco or something."
10/8/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	I like because is really efficient contain every thing you need and the price is the best.
10/8/2016	Amazon	4	NOT A SHAVER ITS A TRIMMER ONLY	Its not great  for shaving real close so expect not too get those tiny hairs guys. Its way more for trimming your hair too a short  length. I had this product for 4 months now and I always have too use a disposable razor  because this just doesn't do it and it leaves wild hairs growing as I call it. Not the best trimmer I have had either but this is $20 less too then the good ones. If this goes above $20 its a ripoff. It honestly should be under $17
10/9/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	ok
10/10/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	works great
10/10/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Lithium Battery is great. Holds a charge for a long time and charges fast
10/11/2016	Amazon	1	Device stops working !	1) Device stopped working within a few uses. There are a lot of reviews complaining about the device stopping to function completely. ( Just noticed ) 2) Also battery life is extremely poor 3) Will not run on electric power from socket. Needs battery to be charged up for running.
10/11/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great. Arrived very quickly
10/11/2016	Amazon	2	Two Stars	I ordered the wrong item and need to sent it back.
10/12/2016	Amazon	5	Convenient trimmer by Remington..	Nice convenient trimmer from Remington with a number of attachments/heads. The only down side is that it does not come with a stand which would be a convenient to store and also while charging. I have bought a number of Remington products and am very satisfied with them.
10/12/2016	Amazon	2	Pick something else and save your money	I loved this thing! Until it stopped working after about 4 uses. Find another brand.
10/13/2016	Amazon	4	Highly recommend	"Received product on the date it said, I've just charged it once and it's still going strong. Plenty of attachments and will do what it's made to do."
10/13/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	No complaints no complaints at all
10/14/2016	Amazon	1	worst shaver ever	worst shaver ever.  - cant even hold charge. - terrible battery life. - had to charge over 15 hours just to use it for 5 minutes.
10/14/2016	Amazon	5	I LOVE IT! for 15 buckaroos	"I LOVE IT!  for 15 buckaroos, it shaves all of my manly areas to non-icky levels, but leaves enough fuzz to keep me feeling Alpha. I mostly use the lowest-beard trimmer (for everywhere), but the nose and head attachments are good too.  Even without an attachment, it doesn't grab or nick my skin like others, and cuts close enough for me (certainly not smooth like a traditional razor, but close enough). Also, my skin can be pretty sensitive, and there are no more bumps on my chest with this razor."
10/14/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	great clippers
10/14/2016	Amazon	2	You get what you pay for I suppose.	"Once the battery in this thing dies, it's useless.  No power pass through at all.  I've had one for a few years (3? 4?) now with only light use and now it refuses to turn on for more than 10 seconds."
10/14/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great
10/16/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Nothing to complain about :)
10/16/2016	Amazon	5	Better than i expected.	Very powerful. Good options.  Good price. I'm very satisfied with this purchase.
10/17/2016	Amazon	1	One Star	It feel apart the first week received
10/18/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	works perfectly fine
10/18/2016	Amazon	5	as advertised	"good product, my second one for travel"
10/18/2016	Amazon	1	Bad power and precision. Terrible product	"It's a terrible razor!! After charging it for over 24hrs on my first shave the power is very weak and is nothing compared to previous razors that I have owned from brands like Panasonic or Wahl. I had to repeatedly trim the same are of my face to remove unwanted hair, a new electric trimmer/razor should remove it on first contact. I feel robbed! Remington have a 60 day money back guarantee printed on the packaging, This money back guarantee better be honoured by either Amazon or Remington regardless of it being purchased thorough the Amazon Store!!? I will spend my money on a better brand."
10/19/2016	Amazon	1	It's basic looks like dollar store gave it to me	It's was a day late and it looks very store bought like Walmart . You simply get what you pay for with this
10/19/2016	Amazon	4	1XL or XL???	"Love it ! Great material, easy to put, u can do everything and doesn't hurt. Im 5'7"" 195lbs and my waist is 35 inches , i was suppose to order and 1XL but i order de XL and i think i made the rice choice ."
10/19/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Shaved works great
10/19/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Excellent product even when it doesn't bring detailed instructions. Regards
10/20/2016	Amazon	1	Two Stars	not happy with this at all. GARBAGE
10/20/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Very sleek
10/21/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Is easy to operate.
10/21/2016	Amazon	3	It took some getting used to because it is a little different then his other one but it works great and stays charged	"Got this for my bf and he loves it. It took some getting used to because it is a little different then his other one but it works great and stays charged. He only had to charge it once when he first opened it and has not had to charge it sense, he has had it for over a month.  After a few months of my bf using it the battery died. This product worked great until it died :( I would not recommend purchasing it due to the fact that it broke after only a few months."
10/21/2016	Amazon	2	I'm slightly disappointed in this product	I'm slightly disappointed in this product.  This does not cut well unless you are using the attachments and not trying to go for a 5 oclock shadow look.  Plus it gets VERY hot from the friction quite quickly.
10/21/2016	Amazon	5	The main feature of this shaver is the Lithium battery ...	The main feature of this shaver is the Lithium battery. The ones I had before they all had Nimh or Nicad batteries and the charge on them would not last and eventually the batteries died on me. This unit has Led indicators showing how much battery power is left on it so I always know whether I need to charge before use or I can use it right away and for me that is a major plus.
10/21/2016	Amazon	5	Nice shaver. Quiet and powerful.	"So far so good. It's very quiet compared to others I've had. Since it's quiet I didn't think it was going to be powerful, but it is. Does a great job. Comes with great accessories for different trim levels, and even a nose hair trimmer."
10/22/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Great Product specifically for body hair and beard, ear and nose."
10/22/2016	Amazon	1	Head broke off after less than 4 months.  Very poor design.  Don't buy.	"The plastic broke on both sides of the shaver allowing the blades to come loose.  The thin plastic is under spring tension from the blades and cannot withstand the strain.  I used it only a dozen times and had it a little less than four months.  Very poor design.  It is so cheap it isn't even worth the postage to return it.  If they send you another one I'm sure it will do the same thing.  Thanks Remington for your cheap, poorly designed Chinese shaver."
10/22/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Works great, quiet."
10/22/2016	Amazon	1	Broken after 6 months	We really loved this trimmer but it's already broken (won't turn on) after only 6 months. There is a 30 day return policy but defective merchandise should be replaced by the seller.
10/23/2016	Amazon	5	Perfect for girls too	Very well made. Battery stays charged for a long time.  Great attachments.
10/23/2016	Amazon	5	Great Trimmer	Awesome trimmer! Works exceptionally well for keeping my beard and hair trimmed nicely.
10/24/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Really good quality!  Shaves great.

10/25/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Excellent
10/25/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Bought as a birthday present for my son. He likes it a lot
10/25/2016	Amazon	5	READY RAZOR	"NICE RAZOR, ATTACHMENTS ARE OK,  PERSONALLY WOULD HAVE LIKED A LITTLE LONGER CUTTING HAIR COMBS. BEARD WILL GROW BACK , NO PROBLEM !!!!!  APPEARED TO HAVE FULL CHARGE WHEN DELIVERED."
10/26/2016	Amazon	5	Remington PG525	Works very well with some good attatchments
10/26/2016	Amazon	1	Junk	I originally got this for my son on the second use of the foil head shaver it fell apart quality I returned it got a refund.
10/26/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	nice quality for the price
10/26/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	great product I love it.
10/27/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Very versatile and does a nice job
10/27/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Love it
10/27/2016	Amazon	4	I love it! I use it for all my hair ...	"I love it! I use it for all my hair trimming needs as I haven't been to a barber in 15 years! Battery is long lasting on a full charge, and I've even left it off charge after use for a few days and still had juice left for a hair cut!"
10/28/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great price. So far the product works well. Easy to use and to change attachments.
10/28/2016	Amazon	5	Excellent price for the quality of the product	"Works really well, no pulling. Comes with a charger and comes pre-charged. Excellent price for the quality of the product. Super please with this purchase."
10/29/2016	Amazon	4	Easy to use	Easy to use. Many different heads. Long charge time
10/29/2016	Amazon	1	Worked fine when charged	"Just threw it away after only two months. Worked fine when charged, but that only lasted for less than two minutes. Couldn't even finish one shave."
10/29/2016	Amazon	3	Three Stars	Compact
10/30/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	it last forever
10/31/2016	Amazon	5	Great Clipper at 2x the Price	"Ok, so I bought this for a few reasons. The first being the foil attachment as well as the trimmer, the lithium battery (which I'll get in to later) and the dual voltage transformer which means I can travel with it. I had no good or bad expectations on ordering since I've used this brand before without much bias either way and recently came from a wahl clipper that was ok. I've also found the $70+ trimmers not much different in terms of ability or comfort but significantly more robust in battery life which is attributable to the Li-ion battery pack which this clipper has....and wow, let me tell you... I used this thing for a month after getting it nearly every other day without having charged it and the battery just kept going. If fact it finally gave out today which prompted this review. It cuts as well as any other and the battery is just phenomenal. Easily 5 stars at twice the price."
10/31/2016	Amazon	5	This is easy to use and very small compared to normal electric ...	This is easy to use and very small compared to normal electric razors.  It works great for trimming neck hair.
11/1/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Cuts well and battery is amazing along with all the attachments.
11/1/2016	Amazon	5	Much Better Quality than trimmers we've tried before!	"My husband LOVES THIS! He has gone through two trimmers by another brand and we've been disappointed in the time they held up. So this time we tried this company instead and right away he said the way its made is more substantial and sturdier. He also loves the way the diff tools attach, much more than with his past trimmers. The blades are self sharpening, you can rinse all the pieces under water to clean, and the charge holds up well. He's very happy with it! Yay! I won't have to shop for another any time soon!"
11/1/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great product for the price.
11/1/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	does a nice job
11/1/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great improvement over the old model.
11/1/2016	Amazon	5	Remington	Great product.
11/1/2016	Amazon	3	Cuts well sharp light fine ergonomics - only down side is a terrible battery ...	"I mean I can't complain too much, it was a $15 dollar razor... Cuts well sharp light fine ergonomics - only down side is a terrible battery life, expect it to not hold a charge after a couple weeks."
11/2/2016	Amazon	5	Very good trimmer.	"I love this trimmer. I had a similar model of remington trimmer that I inherited from my son, and the battery finally gave out on it. With my previous model I had to use scissors to trim my mustache and fine tune my beard, but with this new one I hardly have to touch my scissors at all."
11/2/2016	Amazon	5	love it	love the product I use it so often I usually break it once per year...
11/2/2016	Amazon	5	I highly recommend seller to any Buyer	items recv'd as pictured and described.  I highly recommend seller to any Buyer....
11/2/2016	Amazon	2	"Awful battery life, acceptable short term shaver."	"Worked great for a few months. Blade dulled and slowed down and now it won't take a charge. Picked up a BRAUN from goodwill and I've been using it for about a year. That old pos holds a charge better than this. It would be acceptable if the thing at least ran off of the charger, but it doesn't. Makes a nice paperweight now."
11/2/2016	Amazon	2	Clunky design.	"Somehow they made this small trimmer ""clunky""  it seems they just attached a trimmer head from a different body onto this.  Don't know about battery issues as I used it for about 10 seconds and boxed it back up."
11/2/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	works great
11/2/2016	Amazon	5	Great	It works great. Fast shipping.
11/2/2016	Amazon	4	This is a good gift item	Can't complain about the price of this shaver. I also have a thick beard and it has no problem trimming it. This is a good gift item.
11/3/2016	Amazon	5	older unit works great.	"Bought to replace,older unit works great."
11/4/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Used it to shave my nether regions, works great"
11/4/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	a great price for a great product
11/5/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Very useful to trim body hair.
11/5/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Excellent product
11/6/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Product meets my needs.
11/6/2016	Amazon	3	"Great cutting blades, poor beard trimming design."	"The unit itself is very nice. The cutting blades are like those of units costing much more. But, the beard grooming guide does not lock down on the unit. The method used to have it ""set"" on the numbered gauge is of poor design and will slide while it's being used. I normally use it's #4 to trim my beard, and have on a number of times, have it move to #2 which is more like a couple of days growth. The last straw is the guide itself cracked at the top making it unusable. Without the guide, the whole thing is useless to me.  I spent more on this unit than on one I spent about $20.00 on but was discontinued. I wish I could go back."
11/6/2016	Amazon	5	Small But Gets The Job Done	He loves this thing...my husband got rid of his old clippers and started to use this one more...and more
11/6/2016	Amazon	1	it worked great for a few months and now the battery will ...	it worked great for a few months and now the battery will not hold a charged. wished i could get my money back for it. do your research first before buying because it was a great price. you get what you pay for.
11/7/2016	Amazon	5	very pleased. The Foil Shaver is okay but not any ...	Just purchased this from Target Ttoday as I was checking prices. Purchased on sale for $15.99  The goatee combs work way beyond my expectation. very pleased. The Foil Shaver is okay but not any thing compared to an Electric razor. My beard had been growing out as my electric razor I thought was bad was simply in need of a reset on the circuit breaker. duh  but all in all I love it perfect for man grooming my face I LOVE IT
11/7/2016	Amazon	2	Thought it would be better than that	"I have had this product since 10/14. It just died, unable to be charged anymore. Thought it would be better than that!!"
11/7/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great product. Fast shipping.
11/8/2016	Amazon	5	Great pair of trimmers as its battery-operated predecessor. Hope it lasts just as long if not longer!	"I had a pair of Remington trimmers that lasted me easily 7 years.  The one I had took AA batteries, and continued to work through all the abuse I put them through. Sadly, it finally ceased to work, and I had to look for something else to be my trimmer/liner clippers. I initially decided to get set of Andis T outliners to replace , but these only lasted about 10 months before the motor stopped working. I decided to get another Remington trimmer, and so far I'm not disappointed.  I put these trimmers to work the moment I received and charged them. I lined up the nape of my neck with great results, and I'm happy to go back to the reliability and durability of Remington. I definitely recommend these trimmers, and I hope they last for decades!"
11/8/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great product for the price. Has every accessory my husband would ever need. Charge holds great. Highly recommend.
11/8/2016	Amazon	5	Works Great	works great
11/8/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	very nice
11/8/2016	Amazon	4	Broken within a year	"This set of clippers lasted me about a year which is pretty decent considering price, but I would still hope for a longer life in a product. The green light still turns on but the actual shaving end doesn't move, so I assume its a mechanical problem not electrical. Overall a decent buy if you're looking to save some cash."
11/9/2016	Amazon	3	Good & inexpensive	I really love the simplisity of this thing. It works well and it works for a while. I will say that once the battery stops holding its charge its not as good anymore. You can still use it but u have to be pluged to the cord.
11/10/2016	Amazon	3	"Decent, but charging/battery issues make it frustrating"	"While the functionality of the razor itself is pretty decent, the battery situation is less than stellar.  You might think that if the battery is dead and you need to shave, you could plug it in and use it off of the wall power, but that is not the case. Plugging it in when the battery is low or dead does nothing for you immediately. You have to wait a significant amount of time for it to charge before it will run longer than a few seconds.  Additionally, the battery also doesn't seem to hold its charge for very long. If I have fully charged it and unplug it and don't use it for a day or two, the charge is gone. I don't recall if it has always been this way or if it has become that way due to age (I've had this for around a year at this point).  I would suggest always keeping this plugged in. I tend to use the outlets in the bathroom for other things and sometimes forget to plug this back in. It's always a pain when I then go to use it and realize I didn't have it plugged in and then I'm stuck not being able to use it for a couple of hours while it charges."
11/10/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	works as advertised - easy to change heads - great product
11/10/2016	Amazon	1	My product broke in 3 months for no reason after ...	"My product broke in 3 months for no reason after buying it.  The charging light turns green when I plug it in, but it doesn't work anymore.  Frustrating."
11/10/2016	Amazon	5	This far exceeded my high expectations.	"I did a lot of research and found this. It remained on my wish list for about a year. The price got to the point that it was a bargain for the reviews and quality that I knew it had. I have now owned this for a couple months and in my opinion it was worth the wait. I also bought some oil to ensure I properly take care of it, but this is the trimmer I've been looking for. Two thumbs up."
11/10/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	good item
11/11/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great product and great vendor
11/11/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	What a deal for the price.
11/12/2016	Amazon	5	"Great trimmer just could use a very few more connections,"	Trims great and is a great short cut.
11/12/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Highly Satisfied !!!!
11/12/2016	Amazon	1	Would not recommend or buy again	Takes a long time to charge.  You cannot use the trimmer while plugged up.  The battery only lasts about 10-15 min.  Would not recommend or buy again.
11/13/2016	Amazon	2	Two Stars	"This trimmer worked very well, but now it won't charge anymore. I have owned it for 4 months."
11/13/2016	Amazon	5	Great	I love this. Bought it for myself and some  friend and they loved it as well.
11/13/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	great compact and easy to use
11/14/2016	Amazon	4	Good but no great	"Pretty good product, but no detailed explanation about how to use it. I was hoping for more robust clipping/trimming, but I can work with what is provided."
11/14/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	does a good job on annoying ear and nose hair
11/14/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Good shaver and super cool battery life
11/14/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Very happy with the product especially for the price
11/14/2016	Amazon	1	Can't line up or trim side burns	This buzzer cannot line up or trim side burns which is the only buzzer I've ever had that won't do this.  Also I used the #2 attachment and it wouldn't cut the hair as it was not long enough.  But the last time I trimmed this with another buzzer's #2 attachment was 2 weeks ago.  That means this one is not right.  I hate this trimmer!
11/14/2016	Amazon	5	is perfect. The baterry pack retain the charge for long ...	"I used for grooming, is perfect. The baterry pack retain the charge for long time."
11/14/2016	Amazon	4	Total price with tax to CA was $17.25	"Total price with tax to CA was $17.25, a very good price for the product. It works well. My previous trimmer was from Philips (Norelco) it was awesome and had a stand for the trimmer and the extra parts. I loved that stand. They discontinued as I called Philips to check. My only complaint is that I wish there were a stand for it. It is so convienant and makes the bathroom counter look nice instead of a trimmer laying there with parts all over. They give you a little black draw string closing bag for that all the parts fit in, but a stand it is not. I would've given 5 stars with a stand. The original price was $19.99 then dropped to $15.99 so went with that and total w/tax was $17.25 a good buy since it also ships Amazon Prime."
11/15/2016	Amazon	1	2 out of 2 thumbs down	"Great product until it stopped working after 2 months. Not worth the money, but you get what you pay for. Will not be purchasing from this brand again in the future."
11/15/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Shaver is useless. Everything else works great.
11/16/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	bought for my son

11/17/2016	Amazon	4	Great Price and Light	My old clipper set broke and this replacement fits the bill.  It has more than what I needed.  It's sturdy and love that its light and portable.
11/17/2016	Amazon	3	Not all attachments do the job	"Great little set for the price.  I'm not too crazy about the nose hair trimmer, which is the reason I bought this in the first place.  I figured, why buy just a nose hair trimmer when I can buy a set that does much more than that?  It doesn't really do what I want it to do.  The rest of the attachments work great though. The instructions are poorly written/incomplete.  They don't explain how to change out the attachments.  After about 20 minutes of screwing around with it, I figured out that you have to twist to detach and re-attach. I only just received this yesterday, so I can't speak to the battery life just yet.  I'll update my review after I've had a little more time with it."
11/17/2016	Amazon	4	Nice groomer that works very well	"Nice groomer that works very well, the only drawback is that it doesn't come with a stand. Other than that, it is a good product."
11/17/2016	Amazon	1	Remington Shaver Set -- second one and it just died too	"This is the second Remington PG6025 I have purchased. It just died on my just like the previous one I had purchased from Kohls. The first one of these Remington shavers broke after a year. This second one purchased here on Amazon.com has lasted just five months. Needless to say I will not be purchasing another one. There is a 60 day warranty and a ""2-year limited warranty"""
11/19/2016	Amazon	4	"Cheaper than 1 haircut and it's fun, too"	"Cheaper than a single haircut and a lot of fun to do, too.  On my full size wired trimmer, I usually use a #1 and a #2 for cutting my own hair with a handheld mirror and a wall mirror.  It's better than going to a new hair dresser/barber and rolling the dice.  This Remington #2 is like a 14 and the #1 is like a 6/8.  I use the #4 finish the edges and the bare blade to trim away from the hair.  The hair trimmer attachment protects the blade, too.  At first, when I unpacked it, it looked like a toy with tiny attachments, but the hair trimmer works well, if a bit slow, not as fast a wired trimmer. Attachments:  the nosehair trimmer- a pair of scissors is more effective, the beard trimmer I didn't use, the shaver portion is way too small, but it works with a quick stretch of the skin, the charger is nice and small.  All in all a great cordless trimmer for the office or for the novelty of cordless.  It may not hold up to heavy, heavy hair or beards, but I don't think it was meant to.  My other Remington plug in trimmer is still going strong after 3 years of every other week hair trimming and even being dropped and cracked open.  Economical and functional.  It's the human, not his tools. The manual says to charge only 3-5 hours so it's best not to do it overnight.  It might not have auto shut off, straining the battery."
11/19/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Excellent product!
11/19/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great. Trims my hair quick and painless
11/19/2016	Amazon	5	So far this has been a great little shaver for the money	"So far this has been a great little shaver for the money. After I have had a bit more time with it I may update this post, but 2 weeks in I like the features."

11/20/2016	Amazon	5	nice trimmers 2nd pair I have owned	nice trimmers 2nd pair I have owned. first pair lasted for a couple of year until my wife dropped them and broke them.  should last for a very long time
11/20/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	i like it.
11/20/2016	Amazon	5	great purchase	"Arrived on time, great purchase"
11/20/2016	Amazon	3	Has lasted longer than expected.	"I bought this trimmer in a local retail store and have been using it for approx. a yr now. Honestly, I am surprised it has lasted this long. I have no real beef with the trimmer itself -it gets the job done, mostly- but the battery does not power well and does not last long between trimmings. I use the nose/ear trimmer for my moustache -even though it was not designed specifically for that purpose- because there is no other attachment designed for that purpose. I would have already replaced it but I find there aren't many/any trimmers out there that I like any better in terms of their utility. Nevertheless, I hold out hope that I will come across one someday. My old trimmer, which was much more powerful and maintained it's charge longer, had an adjustable self contained up and down head and a self contained pop up moustache trimmer. I did not have to remove and replace attachments at all. I loved it."
11/20/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Works great. No problems what so ever.
11/20/2016	Amazon	1	Greatly disappointed!	Greatly disappointed.  I've had this for a few years and only used a handful of times to cut my boys' hair. I was never able to use it while plugged in and the battery does not even last long enough to get through both boys when all I do is use it to blend and trim the neck. This last time I used it I could not even get through one kid because the battery died so quickly.
11/20/2016	Amazon	3	Three Stars	"Ok for a cheaper unit, my falt I should have spent a little more money!"

11/21/2016	Amazon	3	works fine. i wish it was water proof	i use it to detail the junk below. works fine. i wish it was water proof.
11/21/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Love it ! Small, powerful, holds charge long time, great attachments."
11/21/2016	Amazon	5	works great. Nose trimmer could be smaller	"Solid feel, works great. Nose trimmer could be smaller, but it works great. Very happy."
11/22/2016	Amazon	1	One Star	"lasted 12 weeks, will only run 20 seconds and quits. I should get a new one!!!"
11/22/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Very nice my son loves it.
11/22/2016	Amazon	1	One Star	it says GREAT FOR TRAVEL and yet does not support 240 Voltage waste of money and time ..
11/22/2016	Amazon	5	Great for Pubic hair	I was looking for some pubic hair trimmers for me and my spouse. We were both on the hunt for a blade that was durable and this Remington blade sure is. It takes no time to charge the battery and one charge can last you all weekend if you are frequent user. My advice would be to let it fully charge first before every use so the battery last longer.
11/22/2016	Amazon	5	Good quality!	My husband loves this. Charges quick and easy to use.
11/23/2016	Amazon	5	Good value	Good value

11/25/2016	Amazon	5	Perfect choice. Great price	Got it for a birthday gift. Perfect choice. Great price. Fast shipping.
11/25/2016	Amazon	5	Happy	Cuts well and has lots of options. Happy customer
11/26/2016	Amazon	1	My groomer worked 4-5 times and it was great. However	"My groomer worked 4-5 times and it was great. However, now it will not work with the head attached. The nub will spin without the head, but nothing happens when the head is twisted in place. See the video I have attached..."
11/26/2016	Amazon	5	I am a very happy camper.	My old Remington beard trimmer died. I bought this one because it was a Remington and I hoped it would accept the shaving heads from my old trimmer.  There was one head missing from the new ones that I used a lot with my old trimmer. It fit perfectly on the new shaver and the battery lasts longer than the old one did. I am a very happy camper.
11/27/2016	Amazon	5	Good quality long lasting razor.	"Got this as a replacement for my boyfriend, he has very thick coarse facial hair and he had this razor for about 8-10 years before the battery stopped holding a charge (razor still worked great). We expect this one to last a very long time as well."
11/27/2016	Amazon	5	Great trimmer	Excellent trimmer!  Works great and love the carry bag.  Holds a charge well and only needs to be recharged every couple weeks.
11/27/2016	Amazon	5	Iis	Iis fantastic
11/28/2016	Amazon	5	awesome product. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase. Best one I've had in -well- ever.	"Love this razor. I admit, I use it on my aussie shepherd - back there...she has so much hair on her backside that issues appear regularly. I use this to trim her hair down to a manageable level. it's also nice to remove hair knots caused by her collar, etc. It's quiet and doesn't at all bother her when I use it. I have one for myself, too, and it's wonderful to use as a razor. I break out bad from any razor that shaves to the skin. I use this to get down to a fine stubble and no irritation"
11/28/2016	Amazon	5	Smooth action	"Close , very close , a very good smooth bikini trimmer that gets very close without giving you shaver bumps."
11/28/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	I USE EVERY DAY . VERY GOOD
11/28/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Is perfect
11/28/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Excellent thanks
11/29/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	My husband's electric razor died and bought this as a replacement. He loves the close shave!
11/29/2016	Amazon	4	Love it but ...	I love it but dislike the nose trimmer.cuts hair beards and hairy body areas very well
11/29/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	outstanding
11/29/2016	Amazon	5	"Fantastic trimmer, great quality and price"	"My last trimmer died pretty quickly, so I was on the search for a new one, and this one fit the bill without being obnoxiously expensive. I love it! I use it mainly for facial hair, but have used it to trim around and ears and neck between haircuts and to trim other body hair. The battery last long, it charges quickly, and it has been able to easily handle everything I needed to. I would highly recommend this to anyone needing a trimmer."
11/30/2016	Amazon	5	Great trimmer	Hope the rechargeable battery lasts longer than the last one.  Very affordable identical replacement. Without Walmart customers to deal with!  Great deal
12/1/2016	Amazon	4	Just as described.	It was a gift. I have not heard of any complaints.
12/1/2016	Amazon	3	"Acceptable, could be better"	"Easy to charge. Cuts without snagging. Swapping attachments is a breeze. It's a quick and easy rinse clean, but hair does get stuck beneath the blade and eventually you have to dig it out or take the blade off. The stand is simply a balancing act and could use a little upgrading. It would also be nice if the light changed from orange to green when fully charged."
12/1/2016	Amazon	5	Good for cost.	Good for price and performance.
12/1/2016	Amazon	5	I am so glad that I ordered this for my husband for Christmas ...	I am so glad that I ordered this for my husband for Christmas not only will he love it bed if someone no longer fight over the one that they share.  They may actually fight over this one now because its that nice.  The great deal for the price rhymes with everything they need and is exactly as described.
12/1/2016	Amazon	3	Three Stars	Not nearly as good as my norelco that broke after 8 years
12/1/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Works great, Good variety of changeable adapters."
12/2/2016	Amazon	5	Very versatile and well made. Would easily buy this again.	"My wife and I have been using the Remington PG6025 for over a year and we would easily buy another one. I use it to cut my whole head as short as it will take my hair, and I use it on my face and neck to shorten the hair before shaving if I haven't shaved for several days.  Its best feature is the blade which cuts close but doesn't ever nick the skin. The blade doesn't cut as close as a shaver, but that is perfectly acceptable. This trimmer holds a charge for multiple uses and recharges quickly. It comes with an adjustable guard which enables trimming of hair to a measured length rather than cutting as close to the skin as possible. You can remove the guard and get a very close cut.  The nose and ear hair attachment works well too. I would easily buy this trimmer again."
12/2/2016	Amazon	5	Good grooming set	Works as expected seems to be a well made set.
12/2/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Bien
12/3/2016	Amazon	2	Serious Battery Design Flaw Causes Premature Failure	"Update: My unit was purchased a couple years ago now and is the model PG6020 and the listing has since been updated to a new unit. This was a NiCd unit powered by a 1.2V 600mAh battery (the battery pictured). I have been informed by more recent purchasers that some updates have been made to the current PG6025 version including the introduction of a higher voltage 3.2V Lithium battery and a different circuit board. I haven't seen photos to confirm this though, so if someone has taken one apart I'd encourage them to post some pics. However, plenty of reviews still mention poor battery life, so while the lithium battery should be more resilient, I remain skeptical that the battery overcharging issues have been completely resolved. Also, if it is now a 3.2V battery a DIY replacement with a cheap AA rechargeable  battery is no longer possible. My DIY battery replacement has held up very well by only charging for an hour at a time and the improved battery capacity of 2800 mAh is quite noticeable. So, if you decide to purchase this, just only charge it when it needs it.  Original Review: Don't listen to the numerous reviews of this that were posted within a month of delivery! This product trims pretty well and is inexpensive enough but it has a serious design flaw in the battery. My trimmer died within a couple months of use and being rather handy I decided to open it up and see if I could repair it before sending it to the landfill. It's not terribly difficult to open the housing using a thin blade such as a utility knife. The two halves separate revealing the internals.  Upon opening the trimmer I discovered that it is powered by a simple rechargeable AA battery. The good news is that this battery is simply soldered onto a couple wire leads so if you can solder, you can easy replace the battery in this unit with a standard rechargeable AA and have your unit back up and running. The bad news is that there doesn't appear to very advanced circuitry to regulate charging and keep the battery from overcharging. I'm not an electrical engineer, so I may be incorrect, but looking at the circuit board, it all appears very basic and I don't see anything that would regulate the charging or stop the battery from overcharging. It almost looks like the circuitry was adapted from a plug in unit or a unit with disposable batteries, so the charging circuitry wasn't built in. So, if you are like me and you keep this plugged in charging all the time, you are likely going to burn out the battery quite quickly, which is why the majority of the long term reviews complain about poor longevity.  I've added some photos of the opened unit with the battery removed for replacement. If you're reasonably handy and your trimmer has died, it's a worthwhile venture to open this up and replace the battery. I'm skeptical of how long a replacement battery will last without proper circuitry, but time will tell. At the very least, the stock battery is very small capacity at 600mAH and I should be able to replace the battery with a much higher capacity battery such as the Amazon Basics rechargeable AA battery at 2800 mAH that will provide longer runtimes and hopefully not burn out as quickly.  While this unit is cheap, if you're concerned about longevity, I'd recommend looking at a different trimmer that will have a better reachable battery system. If you must purchase this unit or already have, unplug the trimmer after it has finished charging and don't leave it plugged all the time. If it dies, battery replacement is possible. Comment below if you have questions about opening the unit or want more pictures of the internals or opening process."
12/3/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Does the job
12/3/2016	Amazon	1	Unbelievably bad product. Feels very underpowered	Wow. This thing is awful. Unbelievably bad product. Feels very underpowered. Almost like the battery is 90% dead even though it was fully charged. I do not have a very thick beard but it still took 20 minutes to trim my beard. I had to go over my face over and over and over.  Very disappointed with this product. I want my money back.
12/3/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great product.  Got it really fast
12/3/2016	Amazon	5	Quick and easy for beard trimming	"After years without it, I finally decided to grow my short beard back.  I needed a trimmer to keep it from looking scraggly and this fit the bill.  It's basic and easy to use and it's rechargeable.  This works quickly and efficiently at trimming my beard.  I don't use the rest of the attachments so I just tucked them all in the little bag the comes with the trimmer for that purpose."
12/3/2016	Amazon	1	One Star	Broke after 4 months of very light use.
12/4/2016	Amazon	3	it's okay	"The beard and mustache functions are very good. The way it cuts you can tell the trimmer is sharp and precise.  However, the foil shaver needs improvement.  most of my face is smooth to the touch but you will have spots where you can still feel stubble. You'll have to run the shaver many times over and even then it still doesn't get the job done.  I'm not sure if it's an issue with this particular model or it's an issue with this style of shaver.  The nose/ear trimmer is the same story, it's better than the foil shaver but you have to put a little more work in than you really should."
12/4/2016	Amazon	4	Pretty decent item	"Pretty decent item. There is a nice variety of pieces you can change to get the trim you want. Doesn't feel like it will last long (kind of a cheap feeling to it), but I haven't had an issue you yet. In all, it works well."
12/4/2016	Amazon	4	Good Job Managing Beard	Only used 3times as of today. Like the beard trimmer with multiple trim settings. Set simply by pushing or pulling the attachment up and down. Mini foil cutter not as good as I would prefer. Does not cut as close as I would like. For $14 a good deal.
12/5/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Only charged once and it's still running after multiple uses.
12/5/2016	Amazon	4	seems to work just fine. Has had it for two months and no ...	"Got this for my boyfriend, seems to work just fine. Has had it for two months and no problems so far!"

12/5/2016	Amazon	3	Three Stars	Good product. Gets the job done eventually.
12/6/2016	Amazon	5	So far so good	"I say this in my local store for $40, thought it was too much to pay and was very happy to find it on Amazon for $20.00 so I ordered it and have been very happy with it.  The different attachments make it a useful tool for a variety of tasks.  It is not particularly good as a shaver but the other attachments are excellent.  I like the lithium battery and was pleased to find it came fully charged.  So far I like it.  I will give it a long term review later"
12/6/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Quick delivery and works great with a lot of attachments
12/6/2016	Amazon	5	It does great job and good price	I'm very impressed with this set.  It does  great job and good price.
12/6/2016	Amazon	1	Not good enough!	"I was looking for a razor and a clipper so I thought that I would try this unit, but it did not shave good enough for me so I bought another razor and kept the Remington for clipping."
12/6/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	It does the job.
12/6/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	PERFECT!!!!

12/7/2016	Amazon	5	Best bang for your buck	"Best bang for your buck. The only attachment that it is missing is a nose hair trimmer. Otherwise, it is a very smooth shave every time."
12/7/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Bought for my son. Heard no complaints.
12/7/2016	Amazon	5	... using it for about a month now and works great so far	Have been using it for about a month now and works great so far.

12/7/2016	Amazon	4	Lots of pieces in a bag.	Only used it once so far to trim my beard. Worked fine. Only comes with a cloth case...no hard case.
12/8/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Works great
12/8/2016	Amazon	2	Two Stars	This product feels extremely cheap. I find that the trimmer struggles to the simplist of task.
12/8/2016	Amazon	5	working just fine. In past	"So far, working just fine.  In past, with other brands have had battery problems."
12/8/2016	Amazon	2	The different trimmer length attachments are nice though. But he foil attachment pulls and snags	"It's decent. I've owned mine for a couple years now and just now realizing I should upgrade.. Wouldn't go anywhere below the belt with this thing. The different trimmer length attachments are nice though. But he foil attachment pulls and snags, and the nose trimmer doesn't do anything at all. The only use I get out of this is trimming."
12/8/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great
12/8/2016	Amazon	3	Weak but somewhat useful	It works but its not very powerful and isn't very useful if you want to use it on other parts of your body. Its kind of weak.  I am looking at getting another brand maybe
12/9/2016	Amazon	5	This is a rockin' little trim kit.	This is a rockin' little trim kit. Lots of useful variables for length.  Shaver sucks.
12/9/2016	Amazon	2	Cheap product	The power cord doesn't properly fit in the bottom of the trimmer. It doesn't hold a charge at all and I've had it for several months and now it won't hold a charge at all. It just stopped working. It's clearly a poorly made product.
12/9/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Recommended to all. Anyone who wanna give your beard your own cut. Pretty cool .
12/10/2016	Amazon	4	Happy with quality and ease of use	Only used a few times but product works as advertised.  Happy with quality and ease of use.
12/10/2016	Amazon	5	Definitely a must have!	"This replaced and older model from Remington that I used for the longest time. The quality is definitely still there and so is the performance. The quick charge of this model is extremely handy for when time is of the essence. The blades are easy to clean and lubricate. The main trimmer also gets very close without nicking the skin, which is an improvement over the older versionguys will definitely appreciate it. Definitely listen to the directions and do not submerge the main body in water. I used to do that with my old one, and though it lasted seven years, I feel that is the main reason why my old one kicked the bucket. As long as you take care of it and occasionally lubricate it, it'll last."
12/10/2016	Amazon	5	Works great and the charge lasts a very long time.	This works better than all the previous grooming kits I've had. It seems like the charge lasts forever. The nose hair trimmer is the best by far.
12/10/2016	Amazon	3	Meh	Meh. Don't care for the way the attachments go on. This replaced a Wahl trimmer that was nicer.

12/12/2016	Amazon	5	Awesome	"Great Product, Price, quality, and delivery. I highly recommend. I cannot give a more detailed review, until after Christmas."
12/13/2016	Amazon	1	Spend a few more dollars and buy something more reliable	"My husband used this once and it stopped working. It shows that it's charging, the light will turn green, but then...nothing. It has charged for 10 hours. Since it's passed the 30 day mark we can't do anything about it and just have to eat the cost. Pay a few more dollars and get something better."
12/13/2016	Amazon	5	Excellent trimmer...	Bought this to replace my last Remington. Hopefully I get 3-4 years out of this one too.
12/13/2016	Amazon	5	came back to the well and its great!	"had an older model of the same one, came back to the well and its great!"
12/13/2016	Amazon	5	Great trimmer!	Great little trimmer!  I use it almost daily.  It keeps a charge for quite a while.

12/16/2016	Amazon	5	I Approve	"Needed a shaver for trimming pubes... this has met my needs.  Can't speak for the performance or durability of the attachments, as I only use the shaver."
12/16/2016	Amazon	5	"Nice unit, nice price"	My beard never looked better. Works plugged in or on battery.
12/16/2016	Amazon	5	Easy to use	My husband loves this and he says its very easy to use. The price is very low compared to other vendors during thanksgiving.

12/17/2016	Amazon	1	Good only for a few times use	Started pooling hair. Good only for a few times use. Pissed me off by keep pooling my hair that i smashed it before i throw it in the trash. Cant believe a brand name such as Remington make such a cheap product. VERY DISAPPOINTED. Will never buy a Remington again.
12/18/2016	Amazon	2	Quite disappointed. Maybe I've been an old school razor guy ...	Quite disappointed. Maybe I've been an old school razor guy too long but I didn't feeel line this got the job done.
12/18/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	good item better price
12/18/2016	Amazon	4	I would recommend it.	"Everything works great except the close shaver head. It could be improved. Apart from that, it is indeed an excellent product."
12/19/2016	Amazon	1	One Star	Died after one week worth of use...
12/19/2016	Amazon	3	Hair trimmer.	Not quite what I was expecting but it works ok.
12/19/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Good for the price range, better then philips. Not recommended for thick beard."
12/19/2016	Amazon	1	One Star	Charger broke after 1 recharge.
12/19/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	"Fair for the Price, With Prime."
12/19/2016	Amazon	5	Better than the old one	Long time between charges and older accessories fit.
12/20/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Perfect
12/20/2016	Amazon	4	Works as advertised.	Does what I need it to do.  Trims the stubble that I don't want around my beard.
12/20/2016	Amazon	5	Does the job and Good for the price (won't last forever)	I can't believe how inexpensive this was. I've had a bunch of these for trimming my beard once a week down to stubble. They always die from the battery no longer holding a charge. Sometimes after 1 year. Sometimes after 2 years. Tried different brands. Same thing. The Remington does the job well enough. I've tried the fancier versions in the past (like the lithium ion) thinking they would last longer but they really don't. My only complaint with this one is the blades -- they seem to leave me a bit of irritation but for $13 you've got to temper your expectations.
12/20/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Good quality and an even better price
12/20/2016	Amazon	5	Works great	My son loves his new shaver.
12/20/2016	Amazon	1	Stopped working	Stopped working after a few weeks and very little use. It just doesn't turn on anymore. What to do?
12/20/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great clipper and shaves close
12/20/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	great product.  works very well
12/20/2016	Amazon	5	"great for ear hair, has some weight in hand, makes close cuts with no nicks"	"So my hubby purchased these after trying different products and finding them wanting.  He has been frustrated with the change of life during which the hair on his head is diminishing but the hair everywhere else is flourishing... especially on his ears.  What a sick and cruel joke of nature.  So after repeated nicks (and having to leave for work with a piece of toilet paper glued in blood to the tip of his ear) he finally broke down and bought this clipper set.  When it arrived, he immediately slapped on that second attachment from the main pic (the metal bar-like thingee with the little holes) and he went to town on those brambly whiskers protruding from his ears... success!  and no cuts!  He admits the only other attachment he has tried is that third one from the photo for keeping his beard at an even length but over all he is incredibly pleased with how well this clipper cuts and how long the battery life lasts-- he charges it maybe once a week.  Easy to hold, hefty in hand, and does the job.  5 stars"
12/21/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Item as Described, Fast Shipping, Would Buy Again"
12/21/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	completely satisfy with product
12/21/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	My husband loves it!
12/21/2016	Amazon	5	Works very nicely	"I was using the wahl all in one groomer that costs ~34.99 and it simply stopped working twice on me. (I've purchased two at different times). This groomer works, in my opinion a little bit better than the wahl. At nearly half the cost, it is a good purchase. Recommend."
12/22/2016	Amazon	3	Three Stars	Not much power
12/22/2016	Amazon	4	Not bad for the money	"Value priced, entry level trimmer. Not bad for the money."
12/22/2016	Amazon	5	Love it	Bought it for my husband as a gift but I love how it's a rechargeable and not just battery operated
12/22/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Awesome! Has an attachment for everything! Can't beat the price for what you get.
12/23/2016	Amazon	1	One Star	Garbage stopped working just 3 months after.  Battery stopped charging
12/23/2016	Amazon	5	Great product	Bought the same exact one at CVS for about $35 and wish I would have seen it on here first by far the best trimmer I have ever owned its like I never have to charge it because of how fast it gets the job done you are using it just minutes at a time. Buying this one for my father-in-law for christmas.
12/23/2016	Amazon	4	so far so good. A MAJOR complaint	"Though I've only used it once, so far so good. A MAJOR complaint, though, is that while the power adapter is 5.0VDC, they chose to use a barrel connector instead of a USB connector. If they had used a micro-USB, that would be one less thing to have to go in my travel bag."
12/24/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great quality.
12/24/2016	Amazon	3	Price too high. Walked in Walmart the next day ...	Price too high.  Walked in Walmart the next day and saw the same Remington razor for $15.

12/25/2016	Amazon	1	Made of harmful chemicals.	Read the box warning label : This product contains a chemical Known to the State of California to cause birth defect or other reproductive harm.
12/26/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Wish it came with a battery but works fine.
12/26/2016	Amazon	1	One Star	Its cheap in price because it's low quality.
12/26/2016	Amazon	3	Not so great.	"Good enough for a $15 pos trimmer. However, I bought Norelco for close to $20 and it's been serving me very well for almost a year.  The main issue I have with this one is that it doesn't seem to trim close enough and it constantly pulls the hair in, cutting me.  The only thing I use it for at the moment is for the nose trimmer attachment."
12/26/2016	Amazon	5	Beard trimmer with many length adjustments.	Excellent beard trimmer.
12/26/2016	Amazon	1	the trimmer alone cut my better half's neck	"I am sending this back.  the foil shaver actually does nothing.  However, the trimmer alone cut my better half's neck.  I used it on him for a couple of minutes to trim his hairline, and he has little cuts all on his neck.  We used a different product for a long time, until it quit on us, and he never had cuts and red marks.  I am really upset.  This is not a safe product."
12/26/2016	Amazon	5	Great Set	Nice set. All the accessories make it easy to get a good shave.
12/26/2016	Amazon	4	Instructions are not clear on removing and replacing cutter heads ...	Instructions are not clear on removing and replacing cutter heads that's why I only gave it four stars. As for how it works have not had any of problems other people have had but if I do I will  up date.
12/27/2016	Amazon	2	"Try Braun,"	Razor pulls at beard hair when trimming. Does not cut evenly.
12/27/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Perfect

12/27/2016	Amazon	5	"This is a great trimmer, he loves it"	"I got this for my Son who has been working on growing out his beard... This is a great trimmer, he loves it, and all the attachments are perfect for all the ""manscaping"" (as he says it) that needs to be done."
12/27/2016	Amazon	3	Three Stars	Great product!
12/27/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	got this for my sons and my brother
12/27/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Got this for my son and he is very happy with it
12/28/2016	Amazon	5	Great trimmer for the price	Gives a semi-close shave No pulling No scratching or burns The adapters are a nice addition
12/28/2016	Amazon	1	Okay for 3 months	Worked well for about 3 months then stopped holding a charge.
12/28/2016	Amazon	5	Every time he uses it he tells me it's the best gift I could have ever bought him	My son would go to the barber once a week for a facial cleanup. Then he started borrowing my husband's every other day. Every time he uses it he tells me it's the best gift I could have ever bought him.
12/28/2016	Amazon	5	perfect	"Comes with multiple heads that are easy to twist off, plenty of attachments to cut to various lengths, and does come with the organization tray."
12/29/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	awesome product
12/29/2016	Amazon	4	Great Price!	"It's great for the price.  It does what it's suppose to do.  Trims great.  The foil shaver however is pretty useless, but I doubt you would use this exclusively for that function."
12/29/2016	Amazon	5	I like it	I have one of these and love it. Bought this one as a gift.
12/29/2016	Amazon	1	Do not buy this trash	"I used this trimmer for the first time this morning to test it out. Instantly thought it was great. With the many attachments, it cut close where I wanted close and trimmed my beard well. After this I decided to give it a good charge since it was brand new. About 3 hours later, I take it off the charger and flip the switch and. . . Nothing! I have changed the head, plugged it up again, and tried everything. It is totally dead. I originally thought I had a great trimmer for the price. Turns out I had an expensive single shave."
12/29/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Great
12/29/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Works good!
12/30/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Husband uses these to shave his head and trim beard.
12/30/2016	Amazon	5	A really good value	"Great trimmer for your face or body.  Wish it was a little more water proof since i've had one ruined in the past by too much exposure to water, but for the price it's a great trimmer.  Very happy with it and all the accessories."
12/30/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	I honestly love it!
12/30/2016	Amazon	5	10/10 No brainer	"Amazing product, have been using for close to 6 months now and really versatile for whatever length your going for...10/10 definitely getting moneys worth!"
12/30/2016	Amazon	3	Charger is not working.	"I used it for 2 times until it was fully charged, after that I am unable to charge it. As i understood charges is not working.  I'd like to know if it is possible to find any replacement chargers for it?"
12/30/2016	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great!!
12/30/2016	Amazon	1	brand new package with old product inside.	Looks like it has been used already. The shaves had rust inside and the handle looks like the product has been used for years.  Was surprised to receive a old product which was title new one.  Regards Sabindra

12/31/2016	Amazon	1	Broken Junk!	"This was a total waste and piece of junk, we charged it fully and used it one time before it just wouldn't turn on anymore... save your money and buy a better product!!"
12/31/2016	Amazon	2	Two Stars	"Not very good, but you get what you pay for."
12/31/2016	Amazon	5	Great gift	I love the stand. Came a lot faster than expected especially around holiday time.
12/31/2016	Amazon	4	Four Stars	It's good but it's too small.
12/31/2016	Amazon	2	CHEAP	Unimpressed with this item. Does not hold a charge. Underpowerd. Extremely cheap construction.
12/31/2016	Amazon	5	Would purchase again	Great value! Husband says it works way better than the more expensive one he replaced.
12/31/2016	Amazon	4	... used this one time but it seems to work great. It's definitely a good travel accessory	I have only used this one time but it seems to work great. It's definitely a good travel accessory.

1/1/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great trimmer
1/1/2017	Amazon	5	"Excellent razor!!! Fast, quiet, holding up nicely so far ..."	"Exactly what I need (the small foil shaver to get those areas above the lip near the nose that a blade always seems to miss). Excellent razor!!! Fast, quiet, holding up nicely so far ..."
1/1/2017	Amazon	1	Possibly bad... Info needed	"This is my first time using a electric razor/ beard trimmer.  The first and only time I used it I tried removing my beard trying to grow around my goatee.  At first I did not use any attachments to remove the hair. When that was done I tried using the foil attachment to finish the job to have a smooth shave. The foil was so small and did not remove anything, it really just hurt pulling at the left over hair.  As it was my first time using this I don't know if I was using it right. I wanted smooth skin like a standard razor and cream does. I was tired of buying razors and cream to shave and thought this was the better option.  If I'm doing something wrong let me know. But as far as my first attempt, I had to go back to using an old razor to finish the job."
1/1/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great product and great delivery time!
1/1/2017	Amazon	5	it does a really nice kid.	"Can't beat it, it does a really nice kid..."

1/2/2017	Amazon	2	do not recommend	"Stopped working after a month and a half, do not recommend"
1/2/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Trims the hedges nicely....; )
1/2/2017	Amazon	2	Meh. Save your money.	"I have an old battery-powered Remington beard trimmer that we've used for 12 years. That trimmer will grab hairs and leave tiny nips on the skin if you get too close, so I wanted an updated version. Unfortunately, the ""close shave"" attachment really sucks. It doesn't cut hair at all. The regular trimmer attachment is also disappointing, as it doesn't get as close of a shave as our other (more dangerous) trimmer. I'm disappointed that this rechargeable and newer version isn't as powerful or efficient as our old one. Boo."
1/2/2017	Amazon	5	Works well and as good as more expensive models	Works well and as good as more expensive models.  Been using now for a few months and couldn't be more pleased.  Great value.

1/2/2017	Amazon	5	I would say that is a good amount of time	"This is my second time purchasing this product. The first time it lasted about five years. I would say that is a good amount of time, given the price. This does the trick for your basic male grooming needs."

1/5/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great clipper
1/5/2017	Amazon	5	Absolutely destroys Gillette Styler Trimmer!!!	Absolutely great product! I had been using the Gillette Proglide Styler Trimmer for about a 2 years and had always been very lukewarm to it. It had a tendency for breaking down often and could not cut through thick facial hair without getting stuck.  I decided it was time for a change. This styler is the real deal! I absolutely love the power behind this trimmer as well as the attachments! Their are about 8 different length options to choose from! After about 10 uses so far I can not be happier! One of my best purchases in a long time! Great product for a great price!
1/5/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Good to go.
1/5/2017	Amazon	5	Great trimmer.	Great product for a great price. The attachments fit well and the unit is light. Great value for 16 bucks.
1/5/2017	Amazon	5	A good value for the price.	"It serves multiple purposes and has a nice assortment of attachments. I like that it isn't too light as far as weight of it, but not too heavy either. It did not come with the lubricating oil which the blades sometimes need to run as good as day one. It doesn't come with a brush either to clean the hairs from the blade or attachments. Over-all, it seems to be a good trimmer."
1/5/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Nice unit. Have to see about the battery.

1/6/2017	Amazon	3	The battery seems to last well on one charge. ...	"The battery seems to last well on one charge. What could use improvement is the ability to trim nose and ear hair. I have to go over the same hair at least a dozen times to cut the hair, making it rather inefficient. My professional hair stylist seems to be able to do the same in one swipe. I should have asked her what to buy."
1/6/2017	Amazon	5	"Great product and works great with ONE exception--the ""stand"" is ..."	"Great product and works great with ONE exception--the ""stand"" is pretty cheap and the attachments go flying off of it if you so much as look at it wrong.  So just be aware of that."
1/6/2017	Amazon	3	Cheap	"Had this for a few months now  It is pretty cheap build quality and does not hold a charge as long as advertised. I still use it, but just keep it plugged in."
1/6/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Doesn't cut well
1/6/2017	Amazon	1	If you wnat to cut hair get a corded Wahl!!!	Awful cutting due to cutting corners on the attachments. Will not cut hair evenly!

1/7/2017	Amazon	5	battery is great and it is gives a nice close clean cut.	"super sharp blades for a nice cut. Use for trimming around the ears and neck or a kid, so it works good for that small size. I haven't used any of the attachments but they seem to be quality. I like how the blade detaches so you can clean it easy. Battery is great seems to go for a while."
1/7/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great Shaver I use it for my beard that I recently started growing so it really helped taming it

1/7/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Great little tool
1/8/2017	Amazon	3	Lots of options but the recharging and the parts stand could be better	"Enables lots of options and works well. Just not thrilled with the stand - it's an easily breakable plastic, the parts don't actually fully fit and was expecting the stand to be the charging station but the cord plugs directly into the razor itself which makes the stand and positioning on the counter unwieldy."

1/10/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Exelente
1/10/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Gifts for Christmas. Greatly appreciated.
1/10/2017	Amazon	3	"A good trimmer, I'm sure; but no ""charging cradle"" as advertised."	"I'm sure the trimmer itself is quite good, but I never tried it.  I sent it back because the ""charging cradle"" is not an actual charging cradle.  Yes, it holds the trimmer, but does not engage the charging process when you lay it in the cradle.  One must still plug the cord in.  In addition, I found the cradle to be a little precarious, as the trimmer would slip off the cradle easily; as would the trimmer attachments.  The final straw was that the cradle was too wide for my bathroom cabinet shelf. If you buy this; be careful how you unpack, and take notes. It took me a good half hour to package this back up for shipment."

1/12/2017	Amazon	5	Wonderful	As someone shaving for the first time I highly recommend this shaver. I shaved my face and so far haven't experienced any irritation. My beard hasn't been this smooth in months. it was packaged well and arrived on time. And I got all of this at a very fair price.

1/13/2017	Amazon	5	Awesome	"Awesome product, cant beat the price."
1/13/2017	Amazon	5	Great buy	"Works great so far. Haven't had to charge it much yet, holds pretty well. I've used it to trim my beard which is thick and curly, and it handles quite nice. It has good attachments and cleans alright. Well worth the price."
1/13/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	"Very good product, good value and I recommend it.!"
1/13/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	My husband loves this and all the attachments that come with it.
1/14/2017	Amazon	5	Great shaver	Works wonderful
1/14/2017	Amazon	1	This is a cheap and crappy product. The design is terrible	This is a cheap and crappy product. The design is terrible. The permanent guard was crooked and it is set in place with screws and plastic set tabs making it unable to be adjusted or fixed. Anyone who knows anything about trimmers knows this will cause uneven cutting and razor burn. Terrible design and cheap. DO NOT BUY!!!
1/14/2017	Amazon	5	bald is beautiful	bought it for my husband and he loves it
1/15/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	I thought I would try this product since it was so inexpensive but I am unimpressed.

The clipper is ""ok"" for side burns and eye brows.  Razor head is good for getting face creases.  Heads can be a bit difficult to change.  I use it to fill in the gaps my other tools don't do well  ;-)"

1/18/2017	Amazon	1	Dead a little after 1 year of use. Not worth it...	"Horrible product. I guess I was lucky that it lasted a little over a year. Purchased in April 2015, dead January 2017. Same problem as everyone else - won't hold a charge. It will run without the attachment heads but what good is that..."

1/19/2017	Amazon	5	Leg hair	"I needed something to trim arm hair and other body hair. My husband uses it to trim up the sides of his hair. Works well, was able to shave my legs and arms on half a charge. Didn't leave any red marks on my legs and didn't pull my long leg hair. For the price this is really good to have."

1/21/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Seems to be working great
1/21/2017	Amazon	1	Didn't work for me	"Sorry not sharp at all, tried lining my beard, nothing! Very disappointed! Tried shaving my facial hair, barely cuts at all! Maybe it was this one which was purchased but won't re-buy!!!"

1/23/2017	Amazon	3	This works good although it doesn't give a really clean shave	This works good although it doesn't give a really clean shave. My boyfriend had to go back with a razor to finish it off. But for a trim it works great. It  made a good gift.
1/23/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	this is prefect for the $
1/23/2017	Amazon	5	Great Kit	"Wonderful little kit! Does a great job of maintaining beard, ears, etc.  Works like a dream!"
1/23/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Excelente
1/23/2017	Amazon	3	Device is easy to take apart and clean	Hair trimming works well.  Device is easy to take apart and clean.  Nose trimmer stinks however.  Really disappointed in it.
1/24/2017	Amazon	1	Bad battery for a serviceable product	"This product stopped charging after only two uses and in less than a month.  It is completely useless.  It is a shame because the two uses were very good.  It seems that I cannot return it.  So, now I am stuck trying to decide if I try again or just move on to something else."
1/24/2017	Amazon	5	Recommended for its price.	"I only used it once for now but I love it. I hope it will stand the proof of time... and the battery will be good long. It is a little small actually, but for the price it's perfect. Feels like a perfect travel electric razor."
1/24/2017	Amazon	5	works well	works great. I like the different extensions.
1/24/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Good product. nice attachments
1/24/2017	Amazon	5	so much fun	"i shaved my wifes puck, we both love it!"
1/24/2017	Amazon	5	5 stars	Awesome shaver and groomer for a very inexpensive price.
1/24/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	WORKS GREAT
1/24/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	My husband really likes this and uses it often
1/25/2017	Amazon	1	cheap breaks	Quit working in less than a month. Very cheaply made
1/25/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Horrible battery life. Way underpowered. Do not purchase.
1/25/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Good product.  Easy to use.
1/25/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Super Primo Fine!
1/25/2017	Amazon	2	Not worth the money...	"I keep my face and head at the same length, stubble. My old trimmer died after 10+ years, and thought this one looked like a good replacement. I use it with no guards on my face and head. I have used the foil shaver on my face, and I have also used the adjustable length guard. It did well on my mustache and  goatee using the adjustable guard. If you want to utilize the foil shaver it is as close to useless as it gets. For the no guard stubble, it leaves random longer hairs that annoy me, and the blade gets uncomfortable hot after only half my face. The only reason that I am giving this 2 stars is the fact that it did well enough with the adjustable guard. However, this doesn't adjust very freely, fitting very tight to the trimmer, making it slide hard. I have yet to try the other attachments."
1/26/2017	Amazon	4	and comes with plenty of attachments to insure the perfect length of trim	"I use this every other day to keep up appearances and have had no real issues. As it is wireless, it doesn't have quite the power of traditional trimmers but it gets the job done, and comes with plenty of attachments to insure the perfect length of trim. Overall this is a great product that not only works well, but also arrived on time, and in perfect shape! For the price this trimmer blows the rest out of the water and I would highly recommend it as a purchase."
1/26/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Great price, just what I was looking for."
1/26/2017	Amazon	5	Everything I need at a great price.	Does a great job and lot less expensive that most I reviewed. Primarily use it for beard trimming plus ears and nose. I shave my head so I don't need it for heavy use.
1/26/2017	Amazon	2	Two Stars	Not a sturdy caddy. Attachments always falling off.
1/26/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	excellent kit
1/26/2017	Amazon	5	Great item	Works great so far.
1/27/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Very  Happy
1/27/2017	Amazon	1	Blades are incredibly dull.	I successfully used this once and now the blades are dull and snag everything you try to cut with it. It's only a couple weeks old and all it does is yank on hair.
1/27/2017	Amazon	5	Great buy for the money...	Excellent addition to the sink counter..... The only thing hokey about this product is the stand it comes on ... be ready to be picking up all the pieces off the bathroom floor when you just bump that display
1/27/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Nice little trimmer
1/27/2017	Amazon	5	Works well!	"Bought for my 16 year old.  Now I can deal with his facial ""scruff"" when school is out!"
1/27/2017	Amazon	4	Great at everything except charging overseas (220V)	"I really like this product, not sure if it's all the old battery operated ones I don't like or what, but this holds a charge well and is light. Lots of attachments, everything you need. Why not 5 star? This is an electric clipper perfect for traveling if only it came with a dual voltage charger.. I mean who doesn't make dual voltage chargers any more?"
1/27/2017	Amazon	5	"Great product, good head pieces"	"Great product, good head pieces, just a solid product, but could use a more powerful motor. But, would buy from again, and a great economical product."
1/27/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great for nose hairs. Was able to cut my husbands hair with no problem. Easy to learn to use.
1/28/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	The small attachment pulled on nose hairs but other than that it worked well.
1/29/2017	Amazon	1	Waste of money	"Don't bother . I bought this for my boyfriend and after just 4 uses , it stopped working . It won't hold a charge at all."
1/29/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Big improvement over my old one that I've had for many years.  Rechargable battery stays powerful.
1/29/2017	Amazon	2	Everything works fine except for the shaver attachment	"Everything works fine except for the shaver attachment.Does not shave at all! Would not buy again as the shaving was the most important for my husband as he needed for use when traveling.Very dissapointed,and would not buy again."
1/29/2017	Amazon	5	Would buy it	Works great holds charge for a long time. Cons a bit to big.
1/29/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"GREST PRICE ON A NEW SHAVER, NEEDED TO REPLACE THE 10 YEAR OLD ONE"
1/29/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	he loved it
1/30/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	trimmer works excellent.
1/30/2017	Amazon	3	Three Stars	The noise hair clipper is not good.
1/30/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	"Great tool, but the shaving bit is a bit wonky, the trimmer works awesome though, would recommend"
1/30/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works well and holds a charge for long time!
1/30/2017	Amazon	1	Buy something else	"Remington says it's a full size trimmer, maybe if your head is the size of a tennis ball...the foil shaver is worthless. Not a very good product for the money..."
1/30/2017	Amazon	5	"It is really good, so much better than even more expensive ones"	"I have had those for 2 years already, just got a new one now because a friend asked the old one as a present. It is really good, so much better than even more expensive ones. It is a great deal for its price. I even use it to cut my hair, two years since I have last been to a barber shop"
1/30/2017	Amazon	5	"No complaints, is portable."	Got this for my boyfriend for a Christmas gift and he loves it. Fits perfectly in a travel bag for when he is on the go.
1/30/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Had for a while and still working quite well. Dependable.
1/31/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	I would recommend this product.
1/31/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	The Remington PG6025 makes my skin feel smooth like a baby's bottom. I highly recommend this product.
1/31/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	"very good product, so far."
1/31/2017	Amazon	5	And it works great. Before I got this I just used my ...	It was shipped very fast.  And it works great.  Before I got this I just used my hair clippers.  I've always wanted one but never bought one until now. This was much easier
2/1/2017	Amazon	4	good product	works fine but have not used all the implements yet so i'm giving it a for until I do.
2/1/2017	Amazon	3	Three Stars	it does not feel as powerful as I expect
2/1/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	I like this shaver. HOWEVER the attachments break easily if you have a beard.
2/1/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	as expected
2/1/2017	Amazon	1	Adjustable comb broke after 6th time using this thing!	Purchased the Remington PG6025 trimmer on Dec 20th 2016 and it broke 1 day after I was able to return it (Feb 1st 2017).  I removed the adjustable comb for cleaning when the adjustment button fell off.  Upon closer inspection I noticed the adjustable comb body cracked throughout leaving this trimmer pretty much useless unless i want to shave all the way down to the skin.  The comb won't stay in place now so it looks like i will have to buy another trimmer (Not a Remington this time!).  You get what you pay for.  Save yourself time and money in the long run and buy something better.  My last trimmer (Norelco) lasted me about 14 years!
2/2/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Thanks I love it.
2/2/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"For the Price Great Deal Plus No Battery,s use it once a day"
2/2/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	It works great!

2/2/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	works good
2/3/2017	Amazon	5	Great trimmer	Perfect I love it! Does all the grooming I need as a teenager without the complicated parts.
2/3/2017	Amazon	2	Serious battery/charing  issues	"After just seven months of weekly use, the battery began to fail. Sadly, the battery isn't replaceable and I can only use it now when it's plugged in - and even then, it's clearly not operating at full power."
2/3/2017	Amazon	5	Very Good	Long lasting battery and a very good ítem for travel.
2/3/2017	Amazon	1	"Works great, but here'st he problem"	"Works great, but here'st he problem: It breaks EASILY. I bought a second one, thinking it was a fluke, but it also broke with the slightest drop. It's cheaply built. The key gear areas are all plastic and not going to last. Look elsewhere."
2/4/2017	Amazon	4	not what you expect	A bit tinier than I was expecting. And I had to repeatedly go over my skin to get all the hair uniform. I suppose you get what you pay for.
2/4/2017	Amazon	5	Works great!	"Excellent trimmer for the price! Good shipping, would buy again, and recommend to others."
2/4/2017	Amazon	4	So far so good. A neat little razor that can trim without ...	"So far so good. A neat little razor that can trim without the attachment and without scraping my skin off or nicking me up. Works well, holds the charge pretty well and wasn't too pricey either. Its small size makes it easy to pack and carry and it washes up easily too."
2/4/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	I love it. Nice trimmer for the price.
2/4/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great!
2/5/2017	Amazon	1	Please do not purchase	I bought this for my husband a year ago and he complains about it so much that he ended up throwing it out. Pros: -chep -small blade  Cons: -slippery and hard to grip -needs a full day to charge to only work for 1 minute -can't use while plugged in -only trims very very very short hair(stubs)
2/5/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Was as advertised and does what it is suppose to do. No issues with ordering or receiving it.
2/5/2017	Amazon	4	and they like	"Gave it as a gift, and they like it"

"I usually dont give reviews about products but this product was so amazing that I had to give my thanks to the company that made this. If you are a customer who is on the edge about buying this product, you have to consider that buying this is one of the best choices you can make. When ever I buy a trimmer, they always hurt my skin but this product cuts through facial hair like butter. Very easy on the face and it has a good charge also. I highly recommend this product to anyone interested."

2/7/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Excellent, speedy delivery."
2/8/2017	Amazon	2	Needs more power	Doesn't have enough power to cut my beard hair
2/8/2017	Amazon	5	Perfect for my husband	"Bought this for my husband and he loves it! He loves the attachments and the variety he can use. I like that one of the attachments are for eyebrows, nose, and ears makes it so we don't have to buy a separate device."
2/8/2017	Amazon	2	The nose / ear trimmer is useless and the trimming Edge is not that sharp would ...	Was expecting something a little more powerful. The nose / ear trimmer is useless and the trimming Edge is not that sharp would not recommend.
2/8/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Exactly as advertised
2/8/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Very pleased with product, works great, quick charging and charge lasts a long time also. Looks nice as well."
2/8/2017	Amazon	5	Everyone woman and man should have one of these!	"I recently bought this for a friend who was getting married, but I have used one of these for a few years now. My hubby and I got one before we got married and it was so useful for us both! Seriously, one of the best buys ever! It can be used for trimming beards (that was the initial reason for the buy), chests, and bikini areas. It's fantastic and I don't  know what I would do without it now.  I think every woman should have one, and every man. Let's just face it. Everyone has hair. This tool just makes life that much easier. It's easy and fast to use."
2/8/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Works great... wish it had more attachments
2/8/2017	Amazon	3	Three Stars	Delivered and performs as expected.
2/9/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	great price per performance.
2/10/2017	Amazon	1	Don't get ripped off	Don't get scammed. This has no business being marketed as re-usable. Charging design guarantees a failure after a few charging cycles
2/10/2017	Amazon	2	Two Stars	Bad quality. One of the main attachment broke after 2 uses only.
2/10/2017	Amazon	4	Did not find the information that this product will not ...	Did not find the information that this product will not work on 240 V :(. Please give this information as well.
2/10/2017	Amazon	3	Good for not cutting skin but not the most powerful	This is one of the only shavers I've found that doesn't cut my skin at almost any angle so I have bought it several times. They only last 1-3 years. One issue is once the charge runs out plugging the power back in doesn't turn it on until it's charged again. This is usually fine for a single person use 1-3 times. But it can be frustrating if it dies and you are not finished so I essentially have to use it plugged in to avoid being half shaven. Also you have to go over an area multiple times if the hair is thicker. So the non-cutting skin is the main reason for this so if that's not an issue for you a more powerful clipper without the charging issue might be better.
2/10/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	very good
2/10/2017	Amazon	4	Good Trimmer	Nose trimmer doen't work very well but everything else does it's job well
2/10/2017	Amazon	5	Saving money and looking good	This is worth every penny. Easy to use and has everything you need
2/11/2017	Amazon	1	Junk	I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He used it twice and now it won't charge. I was surprised Remington is usually a good brand.
2/11/2017	Amazon	2	garbage	Nothing fancy but did the job on my son's hair until it completely died after 2 months. Would NOT recommend.
2/11/2017	Amazon	5	Great little machine	So far so great. Very glad that it is not battery operated.
2/12/2017	Amazon	4	Not bad for the price.	"I was skeptical about this one due to the reviews, but overall it's a nice trimmer for the price. It does feel a bit under-powered but it does the job it was intended for. I have had a beard for the past 7-8 years now and had a Wahl trimmer before this one. They are comparable in the sense that they both do the same thing. Only difference is the Wahl felt more durable and powerful. That being said though, my Wahl trimmer rusted on the attachments and one of them ultimately broke where the connector pieces are.  The adjustable guide attachment doesn't seem to line up to the number indicators on the side. I'm not sure what those numbers actually correspond to because when compared to other guides a number 3 is very different on this one so you'll have to test out lengths by starting big and dialing it down. The close shave attachment feels powerful as it will take down much longer hair than I expected so a fair warning when you decide to trim up the lines as you can easily mess them up with this one. As for the precision attachment, I never use them. The blade width is so small with any brand that it's like cutting individual hairs piece by piece. Maybe would be nice as a nose hair trimmer?  I've used this to cut my young son's hair recently as well. It wasn't the best clipper I've used but it did the job. Overall I'd say it's worth the price, but I'm unsure if it'll last as long as my previous trimmer did (7-8 years)."
2/12/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	"Used this product for two months when it suddenly stop charging, and now it doesn't work at all."
2/12/2017	Amazon	1	Wahl products are superior to this	The on/off switch has been flakey since day one.  I should have bought a wahl.
2/12/2017	Amazon	5	Works grewt	Great
2/12/2017	Amazon	3	Three Stars	it works
2/12/2017	Amazon	3	Three Stars	Works well. Trimmer head is too wide.

2/13/2017	Amazon	4	good so far...	"so far so good, does what I want it to do."
2/13/2017	Amazon	5	The Good Stuff	"Works great. Quick and smooth shave. Not as close as a razor but close enough for me.  Trimmer works well, too.  There is no heat or irritation.  At this price I could ask for nothing more.  I would buy this again."
2/13/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	great product (no review)

It's only February 3 months after I bought it and it's broken and not working. I have to tap the top several times and it starts going again but then stops again. Fully charged it as well and still does not work. Cleaned it as well and no luck. Had very good reviews so I am very disappointed.
2/14/2017	Amazon	1	One Stars	"It's sucks... I have bought this product almost two month, I just used few times, and It doesn't  work now. I think maybe for the bad battery. When I connect charger, the lights green, and it can rotate without any trimmer, if decorate trimmer, it can't rotate. When it not connect charger, it no any response, not matter turn on or discharge trimmer."
2/14/2017	Amazon	5	Great Product.	"Great Product, I like all of the attachments."

2/16/2017	Amazon	1	"It's too weak,"	"It's too weak ,  Shaver not work  is not worth it for the price I paid"
2/16/2017	Amazon	1	I took a chance on this because it was inexpensive. Unfortunately it was also cheap.	"How are the reviews so high for this?  Maybe the positives haven't had theirs long. I loved the attachments. I thought it was peculiar that it didn't work plugged in, but for a few months it held a decent charge. It was a little annoying when I needed to use it and it didn't have a charge that I had to wait for it to charge, but hey, user error. After a year it was weak, fully charged, and the charge would only last for a single use. Meaning if I unplugged it and wanted to use it the next day? Dead. Then, it stopped charging altogether. My super low budget Wahl head trimmer is 5+ years old and still trucking."
2/16/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Perfect
2/17/2017	Amazon	5	the modifying length attachment works well for catching stray hairs so I don't look like a cheeseburger slob	"Not sure what the difference is in a high caliber trimmer but this does what I want it too. When I grow my beard out, the modifying length attachment works well for catching stray hairs so I don't look like a cheeseburger slob."
2/17/2017	Amazon	5	Love the attachments	"Stylish, powerful grooming aid. Very close cut. Charges quickly. Love the attachments."
2/17/2017	Amazon	5	He said it's a lot better and smoother than a lot of the other trimmers ...	I bought this set for my boyfriend for Valentin'es Day this year. He opened it up and used it as soon as he unwrapped it. He LOVES it. He said it's a lot better and smoother than a lot of the other trimmers that he has tried. I highly recommend buying this set!
2/17/2017	Amazon	5	3 months later	It finally cracked after soooooooooo many drops I was surprised. It's just the corner though but it held up very well.
2/17/2017	Amazon	5	A+	Good stuff and great price. I use it for taming my facial hair and it gets the job done.

2/17/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great
2/17/2017	Amazon	1	Don't waste your money.	"Where to begin. The ""charging stand"" isn't a ""charging stand."" It's a regular stand and the various pieces don't fit snug. They're loose, so don't bump into it or they'll fall out. As a beard trimmer, this works ok, but it's not just a beard trimmer. The nose attachment doesn't work, and has no surface area at all. The ""body groom"" attachment is even worse. If the guard is on in gets easily clogged, and doesn't work well even if it's clear. Don't waste your money. I'm writing this review after the first use, and realize I need to buy another product. Yeah there's a 60 day money back refund, but it doesn't cover shipping, and they say it's done at their discretion, which is code for ""good luck getting a refund."" If you do get one, they'll mail you a check in 4-6 weeks. This is going right in the trash."
2/18/2017	Amazon	4	Replaced after two years.	"For the price, I can't complain too much that this trimmer lasted two years.  But while it worked, we were satisfied enough with it that I just purchased the exact same item as a replacement."
2/18/2017	Amazon	5	Best trimmer I've ever bought.	Haven't had any issues with Remington pg6025 all in one trimmer. When I got it it was fully charged and I used it for about a month off and on before I had to charge. All the pieces that come with it seem like pretty good quality I have no regrets in buying this. I would buy it again
2/18/2017	Amazon	2	Not reliable	Used for two months and already stopped working.
2/19/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	My husband likes all the attachments.
2/19/2017	Amazon	2	Stopped working after 6 months	Stopped working after 6 months. Doesn't charge anymore
2/19/2017	Amazon	2	Two Stars	The price says what it is!
2/19/2017	Amazon	1	It worked great for almost 2 months	"Well... It worked great for almost 2 months.  Then refused to run for longer than 5 seconds at a time, even when plugged in.  Not sure what the mechanical issue could be, but I will never buy remington again.  And I suggest you spend your money elsewhere."
2/20/2017	Amazon	3	Meh.	"I got this for my husband and, while he likes it, some of the attachments don't seem to work as well as I thought they would. It's also a lot smaller than I assumed it would be for a man-sized hand."
2/20/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great and the battery life is long!

2/22/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Totally effective and holds it's charge.
2/22/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Missing one of the attachments
2/22/2017	Amazon	2	stopped working	This is the dad posting - I travel frequently and so bought this for the price and the attachments.  I used it for about 4-5 times and now it doesn't charge or light up signifying that its plugged in.  I took a video of it but with the bad internet that I have out here in my deployed location I can't upload.  Would not recommend unless you are able to use it for at least 100 times.
2/22/2017	Amazon	4	East Trimmer	Works fine. I thought the head would be a bit larger.

2/23/2017	Amazon	5	Good combination of shaving heads.	Good combination of shaving heads.  Convenient to use.  Charge lasts a long time
2/23/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works good and the fact I can use it while it is plugged up.. makes it even better
2/23/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	great price low vibration
2/24/2017	Amazon	1	Not what I expected	"I bought this thinking I could use it both for when I want to be clean shaving as well as when I wanted to just keep a trimmed beard. The foil shaver on this however makes that next to impossible as it would take me way too long to shave my entire face with that dinky thing.  I had expected it to be smaller than a regular foil shaver but the pictures are slightly misleading as they make it look like it is nearly as wide as the trimmer itself, it is nowhere near that wide on mine. It approximately the width of a nickle.  As a trimmer however it seems to be ok. Not quite as good as the one it is replacing but at less than half the cost one can't be too picky."
2/24/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Is everything it claims to be.
2/24/2017	Amazon	5	"Great trimmer,  poorly designed stand."	"Great battery life and fast charging. Lots of power from an inexpensive trimmer.  Well thought out attachments that really do what the were designed for.  The included stand isn't very good though, the attachments don't fit snugly enough on on their respective mounting protrusions and they fall of if you just lightly disturb them with a bump or while grabbing an attachment. But as far as the trimmer goes, and how it works,  I'm quite pleased.  Chunk."
2/24/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Happy with purchase
2/24/2017	Amazon	3	Three Stars	a little weak but does the job
2/24/2017	Amazon	5	Great!	So far love this trimmer! Works great for getting a straight line at hair line on neck. Love that it's rechargeable and doesn't require batteries like my old trimmer.
2/25/2017	Amazon	5	Great value	"I keep my head and body hair trimmed very short.  This was the most satisfyingly simple experience of use I've had.  Can't believe the quality for the price.  I'm sure a professional grade product would have something more to offer, but for what I paid for this, I couldn't be more satisfied."
2/25/2017	Amazon	5	Great razor!	"Razor works great to trim my bear. Comes with 1"", 2"", 3"" guards that fit over the blade."
2/25/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	love it
2/25/2017	Amazon	1	"Maybe mine was defective, but..."	"Looking at other reviews, I wonder if I somehow just got a bad one?? As a set of clippers for quick-and-dirty trims, these are good if you can't get anything else. The trimmer head, however, is the only thing about this that makes it more than a cumbersome paperweight.  The shaving head is completely and totally useless. It doesn't shave. I have tried everything short of black magic, and the best I can get is a vague shortening of a couple of hairs. The detail trimmer sort of works, but again--very limited functionality. If I had known how totally useless this thing would be, I never would have purchased it."
2/25/2017	Amazon	5	... I don't have to charge it all the time like the one I had before	It has a lot of power and I don't have to charge it all the time like the one I had before. Very good!!!

2/25/2017	Amazon	5	Remington	Great product...As advertised.
2/26/2017	Amazon	1	Don't buy this product	Worked well for 3 months and then just died.
2/27/2017	Amazon	4	Great trimmer if you don't want to use the attachments	"I like this. It is durable, and works great. The attachments don't work very well, but that doesn't affect me because I only use the trimmer with no extensions."
2/27/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	great item
2/27/2017	Amazon	4	Good trimmer but ...	This is a good trimmer with some useful attachments. The coil shaver is very helpful for doing detailed styling. Battery life is decent as well.  I am not rating it 5 since it's a bit less powerful compared to some other trimmers I have used in the past. Also the body grooming comp is useless especially for people with more body hair.
2/27/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	great experience in trimming beard.
2/27/2017	Amazon	5	first month has gone really well	Has worked fine for the first month.  Very well actually. I would recommend at this point
2/27/2017	Amazon	5	Great product. Great price.	This is my 2nd one (Charger accidentally got thrown away on the first one). Holds a charge so I only have to bring the trimmer when traveling.
2/27/2017	Amazon	2	Cheap quality	Cheap! The clipper broke not even a month after I bought it and I don't even use it that often! You get what you pay for!
2/28/2017	Amazon	5	Better!	"Comes with a lot of attachments, the groomer itself is easy to use compared to other products I've used before."

Maybe someone knocked it off the counter, maybe I got a faulty product. It is a good thing I accidentally bought two or my face wouldn't be shaved for going out tonight.  It does cut well and I think it is great that it runs while being charged. Hopefully, my second one will have a better life. RIP #1."
3/1/2017	Amazon	5	"The best priced, well made unit"	"UNBELIEVABLE! The best priced, well made unit.  These run $25-30 in the big box stores! I use mine every week for several minutes each time and, it's now showing any sign of slowing down due to the battery getting weak.  AND, I've NEVER charged it. Open the box upon receiving and, I've used it ever since then! BUY THIS ONE!"

3/1/2017	Amazon	1	Not the quality I had hoped for	"I've had this razor less than 2 months and one of the prongs on the main guard has already snapped off. I really only use it once a week to trim my beard. The razor does not shave very well. I have to go over spots 2-3 times to get it even. It's outside of the ""return window"" so I guess I will dig my old one out of the garage."
3/1/2017	Amazon	1	WASTE OF MONEY	"used these once and they operated fine, next time i attempted to use them they would not hold a charge. this product is trash"
3/2/2017	Amazon	3	Eeek!	First off. I love the look. It sleak...Quiet.. doesn't shake alot. But for the love of God. Do not attempt to shave your head with these ??  other clippers i use a 1 on my husband .. I tried it with these and he was litterally bald... it went right down to bare skin almost. While I was laughing my butt off... he wasnt.. the foil blade did absolutly nothing... But he liked the nose. Eyebrow. And beard trimmer. So he will be keeping it just for those.

3/5/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Much better than others at a lower price. Holds a charge for a good amount of time.
3/5/2017	Amazon	2	Battery will only last a few months.. max	"After a couple months it will stop holding a charge and quit working after a minute. If you travel for work, it gets to be a hassle trying to keep it charged.  Also, the largest attachment is a #3 (9mm). If you want to trim a beard longer than that this isn't for you- better options out there.  Really surprised Remington didn't pull this from the shelves. Really surprised they put it on the shelves! Its works, but barely."

3/8/2017	Amazon	2	This item was purchased to replace an older Remington model that was awesome -storage and performance	"As far as the trimmer itself, my husband says it is decent.  The down fall is the handy holder the picture shows is completely false.  The trimmer does not stay seated it slides out, the attachments do not stand and fall over, the back three combs will not fit as shown in the picture.  There is no place to hid the cord to have continual charging.  I finally put all the attachments and the trimmer in the drawer in the vanity.  This item was purchased to replace an older Remington model that was awesome -storage and performance."

3/15/2017	Amazon	3	Better for some not as good for others...	"This shaver is used as a beard trimmer for me. It normally trims about a centimeter or about 1/3 of an inch off my beard to a short maybe 1/4 cm or 1/9 in remainder of hair left on my chin.  The three stars was due to this machine's flaw as compared to the competition. The Philips Norelco Multigroom Series 3100, 5 attachments, QG3330. The above product has a beard trimming attachment that allows beard hair to be tapped out the side as it is becomes trimmed. Look at the solid plastic piece that comes with this Remington shaver. Its solid sides hold in beard hair clippings and require the whole thing to need to be taken off if trimmed hairs are a bit long/fill the plastic size guide. The Norelco plastic trimming guide on the other hand has a hole on either side of the trimming guide so the hair can be tapped out instead of needing you to remove he trimmer guide and reset it to the proper guide number.  If you don't use the multi-size clear trimmer guide, I would imagine this product would be a solid 4 or 5 stars. It just does work as well for my purposes though..."

I gave it to my husband on New years Day (our Christmas party) and it broke last week after cleaning it... the blade won't tighten and shakes like crazy. There isn't enough contact to cut anything! If your looking for something that's going to last longer than two months... I would definitely pass on this one
3/16/2017	Amazon	5	Great trimmer	Love it.  Mine broke while moving and had to buy one for quick delivery.  Luckily this one was on sale at the time and I couldn't be happier.  I have charged it once and haven't had to recharge since.  I only use a couple times a week for a quick beard trim but the battery holds charge very well.
3/17/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Awesome set and long lasting battery. Bought a couple months ago and still haven't needed a charge
3/17/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great product. All the attachments make this perfect for grooming.
3/17/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	works great

3/17/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Need a hard case. Other then that it works well
3/17/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	good deal!
3/17/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Works well be doesn't work while plugged in so just make sure it charges before you start cutting/trimming.
3/18/2017	Amazon	1	Buy if you like throwing money away	"I really need to stop buying items like this from Amazon. Opened to find an obviously a USED item, does not even match product number.  Filthy and oily, with HAIR in it. Missing accessories, holds about a 5 minute charge.  A complete waste of money."
3/18/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Terrible product. Stopped charging after one use.
3/18/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Great trimmer
3/18/2017	Amazon	5	This is the next best thing!	I got this as a gift for my husband. He uses it everyday. He hates actual shaving. This is the next best thing!
3/18/2017	Amazon	1	Charger unit doesn't work	"Everything's okay except the charger unit doesn't work at all, which makes the device unusable.... i have contacted remington and they did not help, it's over a week since then"
3/18/2017	Amazon	5	So far I like it. Comes with everything needed to have the ...	So far I like it.  Comes with everything needed to have the perfect beard.
3/19/2017	Amazon	5	Perfect	Great purchase.  Exactly what my husband needed for trimming his beard.  The attachments offer other options as well.
3/19/2017	Amazon	5	Great Trimmer	Great wireless trimmer which has many attachments.
3/19/2017	Amazon	5	MUCH better than expected	"I admit I was not expecting much for this price on a rechargeable clipper, but boy was I wrong! An incredible product that also comes with a removable head so you can use it for a quick shave. And the battery charge lasts a long time! Buy it..."
3/19/2017	Amazon	1	A Waste of Money	I gave this to my husband as a gift. It was very disappointing. The power was minimal and it did not trim his beard. Since I saved this as a gift past the return date this item has been thrown in the trash.
3/19/2017	Amazon	5	Great buy!	Works great! Holds a charge for a long time and super handy! My husband loves his!
3/19/2017	Amazon	5	Hair delight	Excellent product for trimming many facial hair.
3/20/2017	Amazon	1	Poor battery	Doesn't hold charge after a year (20 uses).
3/20/2017	Amazon	5	Works great	Works great
3/21/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great cheap razor that looks like a high end one. I appreciate the carry bag it comes with.
3/21/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Fantastic set. Its small and pretty powerful. I just hope the blade stays sharp for a while
3/21/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	I am looking good
3/21/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Great product, many different attachments, love it"
3/21/2017	Amazon	4	The only one he will use!	"Had to buy this when the old one died, exact same one, tried a different one, but no go!"
3/21/2017	Amazon	4	Great product! Just started growing my beard and needed ...	Great product!  Just started growing my beard and needed some grooming tools that would work on beard as well as ear hair.  I do wish that it came with a #4 or #6 for growing beards a bit longer later.
3/21/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Did not meet my expectation.Very dual blade
3/22/2017	Amazon	5	A real winner	It is pretty much a total groomer. Long lasting battery and easy changing attachments. Can't beat the price.
3/22/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	does everything i need
3/22/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Works great, lots of stuff for 20 Bucks!!"
3/23/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	This machine works great!! Love it.
3/24/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	no regrets.
3/24/2017	Amazon	5	Very nice	Excellent trimmer with many uses. Impressive.

3/26/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great product!
3/26/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	:)
3/26/2017	Amazon	5	I would like to eventually	"My husband loves it. I bought it to replace something similar he had. I would like to eventually, find a stand not necessary a charging stand, just one for convience. The carrying bag will come in handy when taking along for vacations. Thank you"

3/27/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	My nephew loves this item.
3/27/2017	Amazon	1	Not as promised	"Bought this set at Walmart, took me a week to start using it. Horrible to use, takes a long time to shave off hair with foil shaver, I trimmed face first to make easier. Nope, when I can hear my hair being cut, and the long stubble still there, I got so mad that I shoved the whole thing to the garbage and most of it still sitting there and a couple of pieces are on the floor. I should have realized this thing is garbage from the weight it packs and how you need to put the different heads on it. Also, the different attachments do not stay put on the base, so if you need to move it, watch as at least one or more attachments fall off it."
3/27/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works like a charm no issues
3/27/2017	Amazon	5	Great	It's great. My fiancee said he can only use clippers and these would not work.. jokes on him he loves them they work really well
3/27/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	I only wish it was able to get a slightly closer trim.
3/27/2017	Amazon	3	Three Stars	Okay but not real impressed
3/28/2017	Amazon	5	Cheap and great!	Use this handy device everyday and love it. Definately worth the money!
3/28/2017	Amazon	2	Decent...	"This little razor is decent enough. I truly love the little attachments this one has. However, it died only after maybe 20 uses. It grabs hears and rips them out vs cutting. Also the battery barely holds a charge. Too bad. It could have been a good razor"
3/29/2017	Amazon	5	Great item for the price! Long battery life.	"Works great! After my first charge, I haven't had to charge it in the past few months I've had it. I haven't used any of the attachments though (as I mainly use it for my mustache, beard, and the sides of my head.) But it's definitely served its purpose well! Hopefully it lasts awhile. I've recommended it to a few of my friends."
3/29/2017	Amazon	1	"Terrible product, doesn't hold a charge"	"Terrible product, doesn't hold a charge. Tried charging in 4 different outlets, yellow light status on like it is charging. Can't even use with it plugged it. Waited too long to try to return. WASTE OF MONEY!"
3/29/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works perfect!
3/29/2017	Amazon	5	Like it a lot	"Like it a lot. All the parts work as they are supposed to, easy to change between heads and the battery life is great!"
3/29/2017	Amazon	5	Bought this to shave my balls	i bought this to shave my balls. ill write an update later to see how it works
3/29/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	good
3/29/2017	Amazon	3	Not my favorite	I have had a beard for over 40 years. These clippers make it much easier and I have been through a number of them. This one isnt on the top of my list. The adjustable trimmer is hard to adjust and remove. Personally I prefer the clip on spacers. Also prefer the rotary ear and nose hair trimmer.
3/30/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Love myself trimmer best purchase
3/30/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Crap
3/30/2017	Amazon	1	( Waste of money	"Purchased this item in February, and just opened it to use it.  Doesn't work, as it won't turn on.  I am no longer able to return it as March 25th was apparently the last day for a return and its 5 days later. :(  Waste of money."
3/30/2017	Amazon	2	"After only a short time, this product stopped worrking ..."	"After only a short time, this product stopped worrking. I also found it to be too difficult to keep the heads attached."
3/30/2017	Amazon	1	Battery doesn't charge	The battery died within the first month
3/30/2017	Amazon	5	Very nice	Bought this for my 19yr old son.  He uses it a lot.  Very nice
3/31/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Good
3/31/2017	Amazon	5	Definetely recommend it!	Grwat item for the value.
3/31/2017	Amazon	1	This item is crap	Worked for less than a month and did not turn on. Of course right at the end of the return period. I am now stuck with a none working item and out money. I wouldn't buy it.
4/2/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Very good. Easily use.
4/2/2017	Amazon	5	Absolutely love this thing	"Absolutely love this thing. My boyfriend used to let his hair get so shaggy and tangled because he didn't want to pay for a barber. I got him this on a whim mostly, and he cuts his hair and beard every week now. Thank you!"
4/2/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	so far so good
4/2/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	i like them
4/2/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great Christmas gift for my son.
4/2/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great!!
4/2/2017	Amazon	5	works well	my husband likes it.
4/2/2017	Amazon	4	Works Great For Now	Works great in every way for now but since this is the second Remington head to toe I have purchased I can tell you that the best you will get is approx one year out of it before it just dies. Still worth the price.
4/3/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Like it, work well."
4/3/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Excellent item, quick shipping."
4/3/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	As advertised.
4/3/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Practical
4/4/2017	Amazon	4	Great Price and Good looking product	"Looks fantastic and had all the accessories I wanted and was priced just right.  However, mine did not power on. Got a full refund immediately and will now make a decision for a replacement  This device gets good ratings overall, so I might try the same one.  Good Luck!!"
4/4/2017	Amazon	5	Great Groomer	"I'm very pleased with my purchase of this grooming system.  It has attachments for every grooming need, is simple to use and to clean, and it seems to hold a charge very well. I put it back on the charger after every 4 or 5 uses.  The only improvement I would suggest for this appliance is to add a light indicator when it is fully charged. As it is, there's an amber light that illuminates when it's charging, but it doesn't shut off or change color when it's fully charged, so you just have to estimate charging time.  But that's a minor issue.  This appliance does what it's designed to do very well."
4/4/2017	Amazon	5	Best shave ever	"I got mine yesterday. Best shave ever, closest shave ever. Thank you Remington. Keep up the good work!"
4/4/2017	Amazon	4	but good enough	"Works well. Not that versatile, but good enough"
4/4/2017	Amazon	5	Great price and awesome product	Great price and awesome product.  It works perfectly for what I need it for and I love all the accessories.
4/5/2017	Amazon	5	Great razor	"This product comes with many attachments, including a nose trimmer that works quite well."
4/5/2017	Amazon	3	Three Stars	little under powered for my beard and I do not have a heavy beard ( goatee really)
4/5/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Fantastic shaver.
4/5/2017	Amazon	5	Good All in 1	"This was a surprise actually! This all in 1 definitely does the job! It makes it easy and doesn't cut or cause irritation to the skin. It also gave a clean, close shave to the boyfriend's face without the stubble. This is a great option and easy to clean as well!"
4/6/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	good
4/6/2017	Amazon	5	Awesome.	"Great product, does everything as advertised."
4/6/2017	Amazon	1	Not good	"The head gets very hot after seconds of starting it, i can feel it almost burning my face"
4/7/2017	Amazon	5	"Great battery life, solid product."	"It's what you'd expect. The attachments work well, it's easy to change them out. The battery life is probably the most impressive thing, I feel like I hardly have to charge it and I use it quite a bit."
4/7/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	It's great product
4/7/2017	Amazon	5	Best one on the market	"I purchased this for my brother-in-law for Christmas.  He sent me a link to it on Amazon and said this is the best one out there and this is the only one he will use. He accidently left his other one in a hotel room. Good price, came quickly and he was very happy with his gift."
4/8/2017	Amazon	3	Three Stars	Doesn't trim close enough
4/8/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Don't waste your time or money.  I will be sending this product back.
4/9/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	battery last long time (60 min of usage)
4/9/2017	Amazon	1	Broke after 3 charges	It broke after 3 charges. It will no longer hold a charge but it's too late to return it.
4/9/2017	Amazon	2	Can't do edges or tapes.	"I had a friend order this for me. I want to return it  and get a refund but it's not understand my amazon. This product is not sharp enough to do edges or to get crisp outline for the head and side burns. It cuts hair well, just not sharp enough to define edges"
4/10/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	great product and price came with everything we needed.
4/10/2017	Amazon	5	Love it!	"Works great! I'm not a guy, but have short hair that seems to grow faster than usual around the ear's and this drives me nuts! I don't want to have to go back in and pay another $15.00 for a whole hair cut, when I don't need a full-blown hair cut (and the price for a haircut is ridiculous!!), so just a quick little trim around the ear's is what I need and this product does the job, was reasonably priced and I love it!!  Thank you!"
4/10/2017	Amazon	3	Great trimmer but terribly fragile adjustable comb	This product would have 5 stars but the adjustable comb is way too fragile.  The teeth on the comb seem to just fall off leaving you having to purchase a new comb or new trimmer.  The combs are available at a much better price at the remington site.  I've used this trimmer since 2015 and it works great.  I clean it everytime I use it and put a little marvel mystery oil on the blades about once a month.
4/10/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	stopped working after a couple of months. Charging LED comes on but the button doesn't turn it on
4/11/2017	Amazon	1	piece of junk	"broke after TWO charges, past the return deadline, naturally. useless junk like this should be illegal! it ends up creating more environmental waste on top of all the useless waste necessary to make the piece of junk to begin with. SHAME ON YOU GREEDY MANUFACTURERS!"
4/11/2017	Amazon	3	ok for a cheap trimmer; good quality but bad design	"It's ok for a cheap trimmer, but it has quite a few shortcomings.  The main blade is a bit narrow, so shaving one's head is a slower process that with other trimmers.  There are only three attachments for controlling length, so your options are quite limited.  The close-shave extension pops apart easily, so you have to hold it on as you shave or constantly reattach it.  The quality seems fine, and it has continued to function for many months now.  But the design is lacking."
4/11/2017	Amazon	5	Hirusutism	I bought this razor from target about 3 months ago. I love it! I am an african american female with hirsutism. I use this razor to deal with large amount of body hair growth and to reduce the time it takes to shave or wax my body. I usually use the vertical shaver for my body since the head is larger and it can reach more places including my back. I'm going to start lazer hair removal soon and I will use this in between appointments. Overall a total life saver. (I really mean it when I say life saver in the sense of both stopping me from feeling suicidal and depressed about my body hair and turning an hour job into 15 minutes.)
4/11/2017	Amazon	1	Broken item in 5 weeks - can't return - DO NOT BUY	"This item was defective - it stopped working in 5 weeks - I can not return it and I'm getting annoyed at Amazon because there isn't a way for me to pose a question (easily, at least, there might be a way, but it isn't user friendly) for me to inquire how to return since it is broken and it's past 30 days!"
4/11/2017	Amazon	3	it the second one i buy. used the first ...	"it the second one i buy. used the first one in italy: transformer fried!!! incorrect info on page: TRANSFORMER IS ONLY 110 VOLTS! NOT 110-220 VOLTS AS ADVERTISED. you will need an up-step transformer if using it in a country with 220 volt system. otherwise it works acceptably, given small size and price..."
4/12/2017	Amazon	5	Awesome product!	Great quality shaver.  Battery lasts for close to 10 hours if you don't charge it too often.  Shaves close and accurately.
4/12/2017	Amazon	5	Fiancé loves it.	This is a great tool.  Works wonderful for my fiancé.
4/12/2017	Amazon	2	Cheap stuff for cheap price.	Poor quality. Bristles fall off of brushes constantly and comb is made out of cheap unfinished wood.
4/12/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Arrived quickly and easy to use! Haven't tried all extensions yet but everything seems very straightforward
4/12/2017	Amazon	1	It Will only work for a month	It Will only work for a month.
4/12/2017	Amazon	3	Not bad but...	Works good enough but blade surface area is too small to do whole head timely
4/13/2017	Amazon	5	Great shaver.	"Works great, feels good and all the attachments are working as they are designed.  Love it."
4/13/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Smaller than I expected
4/13/2017	Amazon	2	Terrible	Stopped working after a month
4/13/2017	Amazon	5	Great trimmer.	Works great.
4/14/2017	Amazon	2	It was doing a good job trimming my beard when it did	"Broke down after charging it once. It was doing a good job trimming my beard when it did. Oh, how much I'll miss my $20!"
4/14/2017	Amazon	1	Would Not Recommend	"The attachments were not very good if you like to trim at different lengths, and the main one broke within a few weeks."

4/14/2017	Amazon	1	Don't Charge	I order this one and when trying to charge ir for the first time it dosen't work. I don't know if is the charger or the machine. How can i get another one or my money back.
4/15/2017	Amazon	4	Great Product	Would recommend!
4/15/2017	Amazon	5	Nice nose hair clipper	"Very good at getting those nose hairs.  not much to improve.  Less plastic and more blades in the nose, perhaps."
4/16/2017	Amazon	4	Battery life is great. Would be much better if it was waterproof	Works well. Battery life is great. Would be much better if it was waterproof.
4/16/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"great trimmers, good for detailing"
4/16/2017	Amazon	5	Nice trimmer	Excellent trimmer for beards and touch up
4/16/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Very satisfied with my trimer.
4/17/2017	Amazon	5	Great little trimmer	Great little trimmer. Got to replace older model which had lost batter life. This one works great and will run a long time on a full charge.
4/17/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	I love this item here.
4/17/2017	Amazon	4	Get that Hair Under Control	This is a great value and can save a lot of money for keeping the naps tamed in between haircuts. There seems to be an endless amount of attachments. I would give them 5 stars if the foil trimmers provided a closer cut; but don't let that one minor detail detour you from such a quality and useful trimmer.
4/17/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	dad was happy with the product
4/17/2017	Amazon	5	I like how compact it is	Bought this for my husband who was sporting a very manly rugged beard. I like how compact it is. He likes the ease of use and the attachments.
4/17/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Missing a piece of the trimmer.
4/18/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Does not work as promised.
4/18/2017	Amazon	1	A good product while it worked	A good product while it worked...unfortunately after two or three charges the unit stopped taking a charge and will not work. I don't know if it's a problem of the unit or the charger. Either way it's useless now
4/18/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Good, close shave"
4/19/2017	Amazon	5	A trim for all seasons	"A great trimming kit it has attachmemts that take care of all special needs & it charges quickly too, a great deal"
4/20/2017	Amazon	5	I Love It	I bought this for a friend who was constantly using mine.  He says he loves it...and the price was just right.
4/20/2017	Amazon	3	He said he likes it but it gets clogged up pretty quick.	Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He said he likes it but it gets clogged up pretty quick.
4/21/2017	Amazon	4	excellent product for the price	"Does not shave very clean.  Leaves a slight stubble.  However, excellent product for the price."
4/21/2017	Amazon	5	Great!	"So far, it's an awesome rasor! Cheap and reliable"
4/22/2017	Amazon	5	Christmas present	GREAT Christmas present for my son! He uses all the time!
4/22/2017	Amazon	5	the newer version is slightly better. The first one lasted 5 years before the ...	"Most versatile shaver kit out there, with so many attachments covering any personal shaving needs. Bought this two times over 5 year period, the newer version is slightly better. The first one lasted 5 years before the battery started failing, so decided to buy a new set."
4/22/2017	Amazon	5	No good	So far 2 have stopped working :(
4/22/2017	Amazon	5	Amazing shaver!	This is amazing! The long lasting battery not only delivers reliability but amazing power for even the most stubborn beard and mustache. The attachments allow me to customize my look effortlessly
4/23/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Amazing
4/23/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Exceeded my expectations.
4/23/2017	Amazon	1	Won't last 1 month	"Had it for 3 months battery won't charge after 1 hrs of being plugged in. Runs for 1 minute if that then shuts off. I thought of replacing the battery but instead of spending more on this pos buy Wahl T-Styler Pro Corded Trimmer, 1.131 Pound."
4/24/2017	Amazon	5	It's koo	So far so good. Seems like a quality product.
4/24/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Excellent product and service
4/24/2017	Amazon	5	Great Little Set!	Great little set. And the battery lasts a long time. The parts are easily interchangeable. I love it.

I have a difficult time using this product to trim my goatee as the blade is fixed and doesn't allow for the guides to be adjusted.  I wish I'd known this prior to purchase because I wouldn't have bought it knowing it wouldn't fit my needs.
4/24/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	all I was looking for
4/24/2017	Amazon	2	Battery life	Battery life is not good
4/24/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Would buy again great product with everything you need included.

4/27/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Best electric razor ive owned. Charge last a good while. Great power to shave close.
4/27/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Good but not a big fan of the style of beard combs
4/27/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	My beard and my wife thank you.
4/27/2017	Amazon	5	Excellent	Works great & fast delivery.
4/28/2017	Amazon	2	I loved that it cut my nose hair	"I loved that it cut my nose hair, but as soon as I used it to shave it stopped working. I thought that it was the battery so I left it charging for a day to shave the next day and same thing."
4/28/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great product.  Fast shipping.

4/29/2017	Amazon	3	Short Stubble Not Possible	"I'm a little disappointed with this.  I bought a Remington to replace my old Remington beard trimmer, which trimmed my beard to stubble length with no fuss.  The battery finally wouldn't keep a charge.  This new one does stay charged really well, but it's not anywhere as convenient as the old one.  I can't get stubble as short with this new one.  If you're interested in a convenient way to get really short stubble, look elsewhere."
4/29/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Excelente.
4/29/2017	Amazon	4	Perfect	Great for travel and everyday use.
4/29/2017	Amazon	1	Stay away from this shaver	"Terrible.  I tried to return but to much time has passed.  First the actual blade is very small.  Many passes to cut your hair or beard. The next issue is with the 1/8"" attachment it won't trim my beard.  Very disappointed.  In the market for a new shaver."
4/30/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Excelent product !!  All in one  !!!
4/30/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	I bought this for my brother for Christmas. It was exactly what he was looking for. Thanks!
4/30/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Was decent for the price

5/1/2017	Amazon	3	... bought in the Norelco brand this one isn't as good.	I should have bought in the Norelco brand this one isn't as good.
5/1/2017	Amazon	5	Very happy with this trimmer	Very happy with this trimmer. Holds a charge for a long time and I can do everything with this one kit!
5/1/2017	Amazon	5	Great buy	"This trimmer is wonderful.  The charge lasts a long time and charges up quickly.  It has a nice array of attachments.  It cuts hair quickly and evenly.  I'm as hairy as an ape, so I use it in a variety of places.  Hasn't failed me with any of them."
5/2/2017	Amazon	5	"Works well, but will have to lube the trimmer blades from time to time"	"Works well, but you do have to lubricate the trimmer with a silicone spray for it to perform well."
5/2/2017	Amazon	5	Good product	Works very well for the cost
5/2/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	works great!
5/3/2017	Amazon	3	Worthless for face and body trimming	"UPDATE: I'm updating this review to 2-star from 1-star because Remington was great about offering to refund my pre-tax cost (minus the cost to ship it back) past the typical date. I maintain my comments below about usability for trimming with the guard, but between Amazon's ease of return and Remington standing behind their product you can certainly see if it fits your needs.  I'm sure the shaver itself is decent. The problem with this product is the attachments. Both the face and body trimmer attachments make the device almost worthless. They block and flatten the hair more instead of letting it through to the blade. So what should be a 1 minute quick trim becomes a 10-15 minute ordeal to just get enough hairs trimmed so that you can feel like you've done the job.  I've had it too long to get the money back guarantee but I will be shopping for another trimmer. Remington, if you have any alternate attachments send them my way and I'll re-evaluate but I *strongly* advise skipping on this model."
5/3/2017	Amazon	4	Great Bargain	It works so well and I really  like  the  attachments.
5/3/2017	Amazon	5	Great product. Fast shipping	Great product . Fast shipping .. lot cheaper then retail .. will buy again . product as described. Work as advertised .
5/3/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	good for the price
5/3/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Best bang for yuh buck and fast shipping!
5/3/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"perfect item, perfect seller. Thank you."
5/4/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Pretty good
5/4/2017	Amazon	4	For the price I recommend it.	Works well. I use it mainly for nose hair. For the price I recommend it.
5/4/2017	Amazon	5	Glad I bought this one	"Better than I expected... it's so light but still does a good job (at least as good as my old Wahl).  Compared to the prices in the stores for similar trimmers, I think it was a good deal.  It holds a charge for several weeks and the attachments are fine for what I needed which was just a simple trimmer."
5/4/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Perfect trimmer for mustache, sideburns and around the ears and neck.  Holds a charge really well."
5/4/2017	Amazon	5	great value product	"offers everthing i needed, great value product."
5/4/2017	Amazon	5	great razor	"great razor. super clean, super quiet, super smooth. all attachments work great. highly recommended!"
5/6/2017	Amazon	2	Stopped working after 2 uses.	This trimmer worked well.  Used it twice and was very happy.  Went to use it a third time and it had no charge though I had it plugged in and the light showed charging.  It never took a charge and no longer works.  Disappointed to say the least.
5/6/2017	Amazon	4	Good product	"Picture was slightly decieving on size but it will still do for any body hair trimming you need. Probably a little too small to consider doing any haircuts but shipped on time, quality remington brand, will suit my needs."
5/6/2017	Amazon	1	No power	"I tried charging per the instructions, but the device was so weak, it couldn't cut anything.  I then left it charging for 3 days straight and it didn't seem any better.  I returned it for a refund."
5/6/2017	Amazon	2	Does not last	The product worked well for a year. Then it simply quit working - regardless of whether it is used with a lower supply cord or battery.
5/6/2017	Amazon	4	"Good, but struggles some"	The trimmer works pretty well for a pretty low price. With cutting hair it struggles a bit and is hard to get every hair.
5/7/2017	Amazon	5	Great product once it's broken in.	"The first 10 minutes were a little sketchy pulling hairs, but it got in groove after that and been perfect ever since.  Just took it a minute to self lubricate."
5/8/2017	Amazon	5	Light and easy to use	I use these clippers at least once a week. They have stayed sharp and the lightweight design makes them easy to maneuver.
5/9/2017	Amazon	1	Purchased in February - Battery totally dead by May	I had the non lithium battery version for 2 years but was having trouble holding the charge.  I bought the lithium version and it worked great for a month but now it no longer holds its charge.  I would not buy this product again.
5/9/2017	Amazon	5	Clean Shaving	"The trimmer is awesome, it replaces all other forms of groom and hair cutting clippers. The several inserts make it easy to get the right tool for the right spot. Charging is super fast and the clippers are surprisingly strong, they work better than a pair of actual hair cutting clippers I purchased a while back. Each tool has a different function making it easy to groom head to toe by simply removing one insert with a twist and putting another one on. The organizer give the groomer a good look when it is not in use and it keeps everything in one simple tray. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who needs to groom frequently or anyone who is serious about staying clean cut. I am very happy with my purchase and the durability is great, works as good as the day I got it."
5/10/2017	Amazon	3	It works	"The box says ""Guaranteed to Trim & Detail Better"", but compared to what? If I compare to my last set (which died after 5 years), the Remington PG6025 does not trim or detail better. It works fine but it just doesn't trim as close as my older set. It is ""stronger"" but that could also be the fact it is new. I could tell the battery in my old one just wasn't getting fully charged no matter how long I charged it. This is why I specifically got one with a Lithium battery, hoping I won't run into this same issue in the future. Only time will tell. I do like the short recharge time and longer use time. But for $20, there really isn't anything to complain about. It works and I will use it until it dies."
5/10/2017	Amazon	4	trimmer	I like this better than a more expensive trimmer I bought. I with it would dial the length instead of having to pop off and on the trimmer head. You can't beat it for the price. Hold charge well.
5/10/2017	Amazon	1	Poor quality	This broke 2 weeks after buying. Then they sent us replacement and 6 weeks later it is broken. Won't hold charge.
5/10/2017	Amazon	5	Gift	This was a gift for my husband.  He uses it every day!  He must love it or he wouldn't have thrown out the old one.
5/11/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	very nice!
5/11/2017	Amazon	1	"Trimmers get VERY hot, so hot I have to take breaks. Requires several passes to cut all hair but less prone to cutting skin"	"Trimmers work well but they require multiple passes to trim all hair in my beard and other areas, this is likely due to the razors being very fine, making it less prone to cutting in the delicate areas, which is a fair trade off."
5/11/2017	Amazon	5	The Remington PG525 is the very best trimmer ... period!	"The Remington PG525 is an amazing muti-function hair trimmer. I appreciate the quick charge and the ease of changing attachments. It does a phenomenal job trimming my beard and those pesky nice hairs. This is very well made, and it was a bargain at the price I paid."
5/12/2017	Amazon	5	Works Great!!	Just what I needed !!!  Works Great !!
5/13/2017	Amazon	1	"Already broke on me, used it a couple times ..."	"Already broke on me, used it a couple times and I've had it for a little over a month and now it just wont work. Junk"
5/13/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	"worse item i ever purchased, very disappointed"
5/14/2017	Amazon	3	Nice razor for me	"I like the device that allows me to keep a certain amount of facial hair but not too much. And I like the manscape feature. Both get hair everywhere though. I wish I had a mirror and better light in the shower.  I have no idea how the comb like things attach. I asked in the q&a and nobody could tell me. Mine is the mid line one, I paid $20 after $5 coupon."
5/14/2017	Amazon	5	Small yet powerful	Great system for grooming
5/14/2017	Amazon	3	... is alright enough but if you have thick wire like hair it will definitely get stuck otherwise it works ...	This Trimmer is alright enough but if you have thick wire like hair it will definitely get stuck otherwise it works well for stuble and body hair removal. Battery is starting to die after about a year.
5/14/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Fast ship great product
5/14/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	great product
5/15/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Battery life is horrible! Don't waste your money on this junk...
5/15/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Great.
5/15/2017	Amazon	5	Best trimmer purchased	"i have had this four about 3 months now and still  operating off of original charge. i trim.  my beard once a week and have coarse hair.  It has an easy grip handle which is comfortable too.  Using the  trimmer with no attachments gives accurate and precise edging and clean lines.  The small head gets perfectly above my upper lip.  Easy to clean and the travel bag makes for easy storage and travel.  It also works great for other preferred grooming.  The length of charge time is by far my favorite feature, followed by ease of use."
5/15/2017	Amazon	3	gives lots of options	trimmer does ok

5/16/2017	Amazon	5	Win win	The timing was perfect. The product was well made. My husband loves it.
5/16/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great.
5/16/2017	Amazon	5	Tried other more expensive products and this is better.	Solid product. I use it exclusively as a beard trimmer. Second one i have owned. Tried other more expensive products and this is better.
5/17/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Good trimmer, works fast and well"
5/17/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great product thus far... Thank you!
5/17/2017	Amazon	2	Two Stars	"Worked properly for about a month or two, but not well after that."
5/17/2017	Amazon	5	Nice trimmer!	"Nice beard trimmer.  I doubt I will use all the special attachments - I just need one for my beard and use it without an attachment for other touchup areas (ears, etc.).  But it works well, is solidly built, nice size and weight.  So far I haven't had to charge it or oil the blades, will update this review if there is any problem with either of those functions.  Pros:  Trims well.  Quiet.  Battery seems excellent.  Nice storage pouch. Cons:  I was used to a sort of 'air scoop' on my old trimmer, that collected the trimmed bits of hair in a detachable pocket for easy disposal; this one lacks that feature, so I have to wipe out the sink when I'm done.  Not a biggie, but a nuisance."

5/18/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	very nice
5/18/2017	Amazon	1	Do not buy	"Unfortunately, after barely a month of using it once or twice a week it broke. An earlier model I had, lasted over two years. I highly recommended not buying this product. I'm really disappointed."
5/18/2017	Amazon	5	All good Baby Baby!	All good Baby Baby! This is a great price for the product and will definitely buy this many times over.
5/19/2017	Amazon	5	Works great. Just as described	"Packaged well.  Arrived early.  Works great.  Just as described, husband loved it."
5/19/2017	Amazon	2	Battery life is horrible	The trimmer it's self is fine. However the unit is less than a year old and the battery is virtually useless.
5/19/2017	Amazon	1	is so true with this piece of garbage. After about 60 seconds of use	"I never post reviews, but had to for this one. ""You get what you pay for"", is so true with this piece of garbage. After about 60 seconds of use, the blades would get so hot, they literally burned your skin. Thing lasted about 3 months, then stopped taking a charge. Do yourselves a favor and spend a little more money now on a real trimmer, and save yourself the aggravation later."
5/19/2017	Amazon	2	Two Stars	It doesn't cut well at all.
5/19/2017	Amazon	5	"Happy with it, does great job"	Does the job perfectly as I had envisaged. I use the foil shaver the most and it finishes well and the charge goes on for 8 to 9 times easily.
5/20/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	It is not very good it does not cut as it should
5/20/2017	Amazon	4	Great Trimmer	"This will be my 2nd one, first one still going strong except for the foil shaver which I use every day, the blabe actually wore thru the foil, pinches pretty good also, battery still strong and all attachments work well, for the price and 2+ years a good buy, 4 stars because they don't offer a replacement foil shaver"
5/20/2017	Amazon	1	really bad	"It is no longer working Unfortunately, because its quality is very bad, it has not worked for 3 months only"
5/21/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great
5/21/2017	Amazon	3	Disappointed	"I like what I can use on this, but all of the features do not work. The foil shaver was broken upon receipt. I bought it to trim my beard but everything should work. Another Chinese piece of garbage. this was an Amazon ""best choice""."
5/21/2017	Amazon	3	Three Stars	ok for the price
5/21/2017	Amazon	3	"It worked very well, but unfortunately I dropped the ..."	"It worked very well, but unfortunately I dropped the head and it split apart at the seems and wouldn't go back together.  Used it for a couple of weeks before this happened."
5/21/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"great product, does well on trimming my beard"
5/22/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	didn't like the item
5/22/2017	Amazon	5	Just what any guy needs	Just what I needed. A tool for any grooming needs in a slick affordable package. Solid product.
5/22/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Doesn't feel as durable as my last $20 trimmer.  However it does the job.
5/23/2017	Amazon	5	works great	"Works well so far.  One attachment was broken when I got it, but I don't plan to ever use that size anyway."
5/23/2017	Amazon	4	"A Reasonably Priced, Multifunctional Electric Trimmer, But Look Elsewhere for a Foil Shaver"	"After two months of use I would recommend this product as an inexpensive electric trimmer that offers multi functionality for beard grooming. The design of the product is nice and the battery lasts a long time from a single charge. Both trimmers includes are very useful, however it takes a little time to adjust to the measurements of its attachments.  HOWEVER, I wouldn't recommend to buy this product for its foil shaver. First of all, it's too small, but most importantly it felt as the cheapest quality of the attachments. The foil shaver broke apart with minimal impact as I tried cleaning it in the sink."
5/24/2017	Amazon	5	Great trimmer.	"Great little trimmer for the money. This is my second one, first did not have the newer type battery and it lasted for years.  This is a much better version."
5/24/2017	Amazon	2	Disappointed	Its not a good hair cutter and not a good face shaver. Look for something alse
5/24/2017	Amazon	5	Keeps me looking good.	"The ladies can't take their eyes of my because of you, Remington. Thank you for the charm"
5/24/2017	Amazon	5	perfect man trimmer	"Great all around trimmer, for every occasion and purpose."
5/24/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	VERY HAPPY.
5/25/2017	Amazon	1	Don't waste your money	Received this product a month ago. Not what I expected. The nose trimmer barely removes any hair. I am already looking to purchase another one. Don't waste your money.
5/25/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Haven't been able to use it yet because it won't hold a charge.
5/26/2017	Amazon	1	NOT TO BE USED ON SCALP	Ad said head to toe not so. Instructions said not to use on scalp. Last I knew the scalp was your head. Takes forever with repeated strokes to shave your face.
5/27/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Well done!
5/27/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great price was what I expected
5/27/2017	Amazon	1	Six months and dead	Stopped working after six months and about 25 uses. Disappointing but what do you expect for the price I guess.
5/28/2017	Amazon	5	Fantastic first impression	"I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday. It was ready to use the second he got it out of the package. The edging attachment worked incredibly well, and he is pleased with the trimmer attachment, too. The added bonus is that all attachments are so easy to clean.  Not sure at this point about battery life or durability, but so far it is a keeper."
5/29/2017	Amazon	5	"Holds a charge for a damn long time, does ..."	"Holds a charge for a damn long time, does the job and has all of the attachments I need... that about covers it."
5/29/2017	Amazon	5	Finally!	"I've been looking for a high-quality, versatile trimmer for years and have finally found one that's actually worth it. This Remington model has all the bells and whistles for a terrific price. Even the ear and nose hair trimmer works like a charm! I highly recommend this product for anyone who takes grooming seriously."
5/29/2017	Amazon	1	Cheap battery	It worked great for about 2 months before the battery gave out. After leaving it on the charger overnight it will work for less than a minute before it's completely dead.
5/29/2017	Amazon	5	Perfect	Just what I was looking for
5/29/2017	Amazon	5	Really good so far	Really good so far. Only used it a few times but it's running like a champ. Love the convenience of it.
5/30/2017	Amazon	5	Exactly what I was looking for in a trimmer.	Exactly what I was looking for in a trimmer.
5/30/2017	Amazon	5	SUPER HANDY	"Super handy little guy. Its easily portable with a long-lasting battery and lives up to its ""all in 1"" advertising. The quality is what you expect, good not great. It serves its purpose well. I would definitely recommend."
5/30/2017	Amazon	1	cheap and fragile attachments	The attachments are cheaply made plastic. Broke after a few weeks.
5/30/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	"No complaints, works very well."
5/31/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Cuts really well
5/31/2017	Amazon	2	Faulty battery.	"The attachments are great. It does a decent job trimming my beard. What it doesn't do is hold a charge. I get less than two minutes of use out of a day's time hooked up to the charger. Not recommended. Maybe a model running on AAs would work better, then I could replace defective batteries."
5/31/2017	Amazon	5	Another useful device for a bed ridden patient....	My Dad has been bed ridden for some time. He has a beard and a full head of hair. It is very hard for my Mom to cut his hair while he is in bed. He can not hold his head up for very long. His hair is thin on his head and can be cut quickly if you can get to the back of his head. His beard is very thick and requires a lot more cutting and shaping. He is unable to sit on the side of the bed for this. So we needed something that could be used for both and would not require him to be put in an unsafe position on the side of the bed. I researched and went with this. I felt like it had enough attachments to make life easier for my Mom and Dad. And then we would not have to worry about his safety. I sent it to their house and they used it the next day. It does need to be charged for six hours before it will work properly. They both love it! My dad is happy that he can be groomed in bed and does not have to worry about trying to sit up and hold in a position that he really can't hold to. My Mom is happy because it is easy to use and works well for both his thick beard and his thin hair. It cuts very well and you don't have to go over and over and area to get it right. That makes for a more pleasurable experience than the one they would have when it was time for his hair to be cut. I am happy because I do not have to worry about him falling out of bed and getting hurt. We highly recommend this product!
5/31/2017	Amazon	5	A+	Very well made!
5/31/2017	Amazon	3	"Works well mostly, but not the all-in-one hoped 4"	Works great as a hair and beard trimmer. As an electric razor for shaving is pretty poor. The attachment with the shave screen is about an inch long and less wide. It would take forever. Sideburn shaving only I guess
6/1/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"I love this product, best beard trimmer I have purchased!!"
6/1/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Great, versatile trimmer"
6/1/2017	Amazon	2	Two Stars	"Horrible quality, after just 7 minutes of use it get very hot and the blades are not sharp enough."
6/2/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Awesome. Will buy again if necessary. So much better than any other I have used.
6/2/2017	Amazon	1	Not worth to spend on	"I have been using  other model of Remington , with similar battery which can be used dry or wet condition so based on that i bought this But its sad the battery is not that powerful and not  operates consistent speed. It just shoots up power at some point and goes down at particular moment.  I will say try other models of this , but not this"
6/2/2017	Amazon	2	Very small unit. price was right - but the ...	"Very small unit.  price was right - but the blade ""hood"" continues to demand you take it off the blade unit and clean it of hair and back to my first point..its so small that means every two or three sweeps of hair.  Battery works well."
6/3/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	For the price you can't get anything better.
6/3/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	My husband really liked it. It has everything he needs to keep his beard groomed.
6/3/2017	Amazon	1	Battery died	The battery on mine died after about three charges. Pretty useless.
6/3/2017	Amazon	1	Terrible	Used it one time and it stopped working . AWFUL
6/3/2017	Amazon	2	Two Stars	Battery died after 4 months.... guess thats why it was on clearance.

6/5/2017	Amazon	1	Totally disappointed.	"My old trimmer finally gave up the ghost and I spent hours looking at replacement models since the one I had was not listed on Amazon.  This was my second choice since the one I wanted to order was not in stock.  I placed the order for my first choice anyway and waited, hoping it would come back in stock, but I couldn't wait any longer.  If I hadn't thrown out the box, I would return this one in a heart beat.  The detail blade heated up almost instantly and was hot enough that it burned my lip.  The regular trimmer blade pulled at my beard and my beard is certainly not heavy.  The accessories snapped in place and I nearly needed to get a screw driver to pry it off.  The holder was useless since the other blades didn't snap into place and would fall over at the slightest bump.  I've used it only once and have ordered a different model to replace this worthless piece of junk."
6/5/2017	Amazon	5	Happy Customer	great trimmer for men & women!!  Quick delivery !!  very happy!!!
6/6/2017	Amazon	1	Junk	Remington sucks
6/6/2017	Amazon	4	Even though this looks and operates like the old one	"Replaced the same model but several years old. Even though this looks and operates like the old one, this one is not advertised to be water proof like the old one. Have not tried it. Long battery life and great cutting."
6/6/2017	Amazon	2	Attachments do not lock in place	Biggest issue is the trimming attachment.  It does not lock in place which can leave you with different height levels of your beard/mustache after you shake the trimmer and/or clean it of the hair its already collected.
6/6/2017	Amazon	5	The best I've ever used	I've gone through 3 different trimmers in the past 3 years before I decided to try this one.  By FAR the best I've used for body grooming.  No nicks or cuts!  Makes grooming a much less stressful job.
6/6/2017	Amazon	5	you won't be disappointed.	"This item is a must have for anyone that likes to stay trip and clean cut. I've used this thing at least a dozen times since I bought it and haven't had to charge it yet. Buy it, you won't be disappointed."
6/6/2017	Amazon	5	I don't like many things but this works	"It seems to work just fine I've used it one time so far so I gave it five stars but things can change down the road you know how it goes ,"

6/7/2017	Amazon	2	Worked great otherwise.	Bought this thinking it was waterproof.. it's not waterproof. Worked great otherwise.
6/7/2017	Amazon	1	CHEAP.	It broke after a couple uses.
6/7/2017	Amazon	3	"Works well overall, but my major issue with this ..."	"Works well overall, but my major issue with this is the adjustable clipper guard for getting different lengths. There's only one clipper guard with a clip for adjusting the length, and the clip is not secure at all. It slides with a moderate amount of pressure. So if you're trying to get an even buzz and put some pressure on it, the clipper guard will slide all the way down and you'll end up with a cut much, much shorter than you wanted."
6/7/2017	Amazon	5	Works fine.	WORks great.  A few attachments enough to get by.  It's still early but I like it so far.
6/7/2017	Amazon	5	Works great	So far I like this trimmer a lot.  Works as advertised and has been trouble free.

6/10/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Excellent trimmer, with a great set of attachments"
6/10/2017	Amazon	2	Low Power	Cheap trimmer does not have the power that a WHAL Trimmer has! I guess you get what you pay for.  The other downside is that you can't get any water on it or it will short out!
6/10/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	More noise than power.

Tried it recently and nothing happened when I switched it on so I charged it in multiple different outlets.  The light illuminates when plugged in but when switched on, nothing happens. This is honestly unbelievable."
6/11/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	good product

I have had this trimmer 4 months and only charged it maybe 3 times and now it will not work at all.  The light comes on when it is plugged in to the charger but it does nothing when you turn the switch to on.
6/12/2017	Amazon	5	Great for beard and light trim	It's powerfull enough and cuts great. Thanks
6/12/2017	Amazon	1	Not worth the money	"I've used this razor four times and it has completely stopped working. Light comes on when I plug it in, but will not turn on. Was great while it worked, now it's just junk. Do not buy!"
6/12/2017	Amazon	3	Remington cordless all in one shaver	"June12th 2017. Received all 8 items see attached photo. attachments are pretty much plug and play Plugged in for charging 3-5 hours per directions  June 17th update - used all attachments, My original all in one was great; but it is not made any more, this new one is a little bit of a pain having to go from one attachment to the next. Beard trimming is fine. Cutting any hair without the attachments takes effort, blades not too sharp which is good in not being able to cut yourself but not great in trimming on one pass, took several passes and extra pressure  Update August 20th Been using for two months- Still getting used to settings, groomer works best when you find your setting and leave it. I have not been using it as a groomer only for the last month. Using my old shaver for close ups cuts and trimming that way I do not have to change heads for attachments  Will update as time / use goes by"
6/12/2017	Amazon	2	Died after one battery cycle	"The battery died after one battery cycle. I charged it for hours and it only stays on for 5 seconds. It was great when it worked and I am happy to edit my review if it gets replaced, otherwise stay away."
6/12/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Good trimmer, made a great stocking stuffer."
6/13/2017	Amazon	1	Definitely not a quality product.	"This trimmer worked great at first, but after a few uses it would not hold a charge. Depending on the angle I held it, it would make a grinding noise or just stop. Definitely not a quality product."
6/13/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great value
6/13/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	performs as expected
6/13/2017	Amazon	5	Super buy.	"Great hair, body and beard trimmer. Light with great guards for different cuts of hair and beard. Quite motor no noise and it is fast. Great buy."

6/13/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Excellent product
6/14/2017	Amazon	3	Three Stars	The lack of trim pieces is disappointing. Either too big or too small.

6/14/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	My husband loves this
6/14/2017	Amazon	1	RIP nov 2016 to June 2017	"This trimmer was receive November 2016,  It is June 2017 and it died.  It can't say I care.  It was never a great trimmer.  It required up to 5 passes to cut my less than great beard.  I wouldn't buy it again.  The only reason I took the time to write this review was to protect other people from buying it.  Also they lure you in with the attachments but the attachments are cheap.  The nose hair cutter should be called a nose hair ripper.  Instead of cutting the hair it simply grabs it and rips it out centrifugally."
6/14/2017	Amazon	5	Great  beard	Been  using  this  product  for  a  few  months  still  working  well .
6/14/2017	Amazon	4	Would Recommend	My previous shaver was taking a while to do it's job due to me not ever taking care of it. This thing is super quiet compared to my old Norelco and does a good job.
6/15/2017	Amazon	1	The trimmer just stopped working	Trimmer worked fine for 5 months and it stopped working.  Not sure why. Maybe a defective item.  Will definitely shop elsewhere.
6/15/2017	Amazon	4	Great for the price...	"This is a great little razor.. I got a good all around shave.. Had no problem taking down me head afyer about 3 weeks of growth and worked on the beard like a charm..  only thi g i wasnt really impressed with was the foil shaver. Ended up using a razor, so i wouldnt buy this specifically fot that. Other than that totally happy with it.."
6/15/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	As advertised
6/15/2017	Amazon	2	Don't do it!	"This Remington razor pales in comparison to my last Remington (Titanium MB45), which I had for years and LOVED. Couple quick things about this model that I don't like... #1) Just too many unnecessary attachments.  Don't get me wrong, attachments are great if they're functional.  These aren't.  They just clutter up the sink area because they all fall out of the tray.  Also, they are cheaply made.  The one thing I use the most is the clipper depth adjustment.  After a month of sliding it on/off the darn plastic cracked.  Cheap. #2) The razor itself is one of those cheapo ones you can buy for half the price minus the clut-tachments (clutter + attachment).  After using it for a few minutes the metal gets very hot and a first degree burn is not out of the question. I had higher expectations when I bought this.  Fool me once."
6/16/2017	Amazon	1	"After the initial charge had run out, would not ..."	"After the initial charge had run out,  would not charge. Even though I was in the time frame, Amazon would not take it back."
6/16/2017	Amazon	1	The battery won't last.	I once gave this 5 stars but after only having it a few months the battery has lost it's ability to hold a charge. It dies only a few minutes after starting use and that's after leaving it to charge over night. This is a total waste of money and I wish I could return it. Terrible product!
6/16/2017	Amazon	5	... for several months recharged a number of times work? like a charm	had it for several months recharged a number of times work? like a charm.

6/17/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great trimmer
6/17/2017	Amazon	5	Good value	I use this as a goatee trimmer once or twice a week. The initial charge lasted months and months.
6/17/2017	Amazon	5	This is the best groomer I've ever had	This is the best groomer I've ever had. It works perfectly for my needs and I have yet to need to charge it since I bought it over a month ago.
6/17/2017	Amazon	5	Great body groomer	"I needed a body groomer for armpits, legs and privates as well as a nose/eyebrow trimmer and hair clippers... it can do all of that! I was hesitant at first but I love this product. The attachments suit all lengths and hair trimming/shaving needs. Easily washable attachments. Easy to travel with as well. Great purchase!"
6/18/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Good value
6/18/2017	Amazon	5	Good quality and shipped on	working as stated. Good quality and shipped on time

Does the job well if you're looking to take off all your beard hair, and the honest truth is that it while take a a good 10 minutes to get that annoying stubble off your face."
6/19/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works really well for the price
6/19/2017	Amazon	5	"Battery lasts a long time, I have had it ..."	"Battery lasts a long time, I have had it for several months and only recharged it once. Not sure how well the attachments work as I only use it to trim facial hair, but the blades are sharp, it runs quiet and smooth."
6/19/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	So far so good! Seems do get the job done! I'm glad I made this purchase.
6/19/2017	Amazon	3	Not a good buy	It already has broke won't recharge
6/19/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	as described
6/19/2017	Amazon	1	Not up to the job!	"Very underpowered, wouldn't cleanly cut my medium weight beard. I am familiar with other Lithium powered devices and this is the wimpiest that I've encountered. I guess I'm sticking to my corded Wahl Peanut hair clippers for now.  Maybe I shouldn't compare the two since corded clippers have almost unlimited power. But this device is just super lightweight and won't do the job with 10 passes. It does offer lots of other attachments, but I need it to cleanly trim my beard first and foremost. I wanted to loose the cord."
6/20/2017	Amazon	3	Just an ok rating on this one. The battery ...	Just an ok rating on this one.  The battery doesn't last that long and it is difficult to trim without having to plug it in or just keep it plugged in while you trim.  I would look at others first.
6/20/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Charge lasts long and is a great convenient way to shave and cut hair.
6/20/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	WORKS GREAT

6/21/2017	Amazon	5	Can't beat for the price...	"I've had couple of Remington products before and been quite happy, but dropped the old one and time for a new beard trimmer... For this price, you can't beat it.  Feels a bit bulkier than my previous trimmer, and we'll see how the length attachment holds up if it's adjusted often, but after first three uses, i have no complaints.  All the atttachments work, and are user friendly, except the nose trimmer... Bad design, but i have a dedicated one so that doesn't concern me.  If you're buying it for the nose trimmer, don't and look elsewhere.  For the beard?  You can't go wrong with this Remington PG6025.  Update: After several uses, i am very satisfied with the cutting speed and precision.  No hair pulling at all."
6/21/2017	Amazon	4	For all you men asking if it's safe to manscape ...	"For all you men asking if it's safe to manscape with, that is a yes. Except the coin purse. Always use a razor blade for that or you'll be bleeding and itching beyond accepting."
6/21/2017	Amazon	4	Great product!	Great product!
6/21/2017	Amazon	2	Good product but don't expect comb to last	"I buy one of these every year or more frequently.  Why?  The one attachment I actually use - the clear comb for beard trimming  - doesn't hold up and ultimately  breaks in half.  A replacement comb from Remington costs with shipping almost half what an entire new unit costs, so i just buy a new kit.  Maddening because overall this is a good product, but the key attachment is not durable."
6/21/2017	Amazon	5	"Great product, great price!"	"At this price, you have to be happy about it! It's not the most powerful trimmer but it certainly does the job well, and all the attachments are useful."
6/22/2017	Amazon	4	Works great so far	No complaints definitely a good value
6/22/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Works great
6/22/2017	Amazon	1	Weak trimmer	Weak trimmer.  Will not hold a charge for any length of time and will not work directly off plug.
6/22/2017	Amazon	5	Perfect	Works really well no worries of cutting myself anymore like I did with my other face trimmer
6/23/2017	Amazon	5	I like it a lot !	"I purchased this again after my first one was stolen, so that says a lot.  Unlike some of the reviews, I'm getting what I think is LONG usage from charges.  Overall, very happy with this product."

6/25/2017	Amazon	2	Bought for my husband and he says it doesn't work ...	Bought for my husband and he says it doesn't work as well as some of the others he has used. Not able to get the precision cuts on his sideburns that he likes. Nose clipper doesn't work well either.
6/26/2017	Amazon	3	Not that great	"I've owned this for about a year. So far it has underperformed. Battery life has been bad, I haven't been able to get multiple trims since I've bought it."
6/26/2017	Amazon	3	Very Good Except for Foil Attachment	Overall a very good device for the price. My only problem is that the foil attachment catches and pull on any longer whiskers and is somewhat painful. Had one of these before with no problem so maybe I just got one that has a problem attachment.
6/26/2017	Amazon	3	Three Stars	Decent groomer.  AFter 1 month a tooth fell off so not its unusable
6/26/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Doesn't get all of my facial hairs and scratches and cuts me.
6/27/2017	Amazon	5	Very good	Great item. My husband loves it.
6/27/2017	Amazon	5	Great product	This has more accessories than the normal person will likely ever use.  I keep my head trimmed as close as I can and my beard trimmed short and it still has plenty of charge left.
6/28/2017	Amazon	1	Hot enough to BURN	"Initially, this worked really well for beard trimming. Blades of various length were great for getting the right trim.  However, just outside the 30 day return window, it developed an issue where the speed of the motor slowly increases while it is turned on. The blades become unbearably hot in less than 30 seconds. After 60 seconds, it's hot enough to give you first degree burns.  Seems like either a defective product, or poor electrical design. I would not recommend this at all."
6/28/2017	Amazon	2	for the price it was a good deal.	"Bought this for my husband as a gift. He dropped it and it broke apart. Now it doesn't seem to be very powerful or to trim hair very well. But, for the price it was a good deal."
6/28/2017	Amazon	5	Need to Return!	"Arrived brand new but didn't work after charged. Bought next one up version Remington ""head to toe"" was great so far. I need to return ""all in 1"" since the return slip was deleted so quickly and I was out of town"". Not sure how to get Amazon to respond but I'll keep trying."
6/29/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Love that I don't have to buy batteries. My husband loves his and all the additional peices.
6/29/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	cheap and works for what I need
6/29/2017	Amazon	2	Not the best	The quality is poor and the shave is always uneven. Not even worth a comment. Don't buy and find something else.
6/29/2017	Amazon	2	... the first time earlier in the year and I loved it. It was easy to use	"I purchased this product for the first time earlier in the year and I loved it.  It was easy to use.  The only draw back was that the battery needed recharging after every 3 or 4 trims and shaves.  Not something I couldn't deal with.  But then within 2 months, one of the teeth on the clippers broke.  I thought I must have used it too aggressively.  So I did not hold it against the product.  I ordered another one.  3 weeks later the exact same tooth on the same clipper broke again.  There is clearly a flaw in the design of the product.  With a broken clipper, this product isn't worth anything to me.  So far, two clipper have broken already.  I can't recommend this to anyone else."
6/29/2017	Amazon	5	Great price too	Got both of the same order very fast and safe. Thank you
6/29/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	great product

7/1/2017	Amazon	5	Good product and price	As advertised
7/1/2017	Amazon	3	Disappointed	"I bought the PG525 to replace a PG350 because I was tired of dealing with a Nimh battery than always ran out of juice mid-trim.  Amazon'r blurb said the PG525 indicated charge level, which was what I wanted..  It does not.  Just an amber light while ti si charging.  As the literature says nothing about how to tell it is fully charged, it is pretty useless.  The PG525 does not have a mustache trimmer, which is what I though I was buying.  I suppose the 30mm trimmer would work, its larger than the 17mm I used with the PG350, but no wider than the trimmer on my shaver.  But none of the 3 combs 3mm, 6mm, 9mm let me thin the mustache, The 3mm certainly looks like it should, but it keeps the blades away from the hair.  The only good thing is that it uses the same attachments as the PG350, so I am now using it with the trimmer and multisetting comb from the 350.  Basically all I bought was a handle, which does not indocate charge level as promised, but at least should only take 4 hours to recharge, vs 14 for the NimH handle, and can take a quick charge.  I also noted the the old 17mm trimmer got hot while I was trimming.  It never did that with the PG350.  Oh, the nose hair trimmer doesn't work either, and I have no use fora body hair trimmer, so the only attachment I can use is the foil shaver, identical to the shaver of the PG350.  To top it off, the tray is too deep to fit in a bathroom cabinet.  Don't let the picture fool you, the trimmer extends about 4 inches past the tray!"
7/2/2017	Amazon	2	Two Stars	Only worked for two months :(
7/2/2017	Amazon	2	so so	"Not as expected. Its lacks power and precision, really not better that what is a Walmart for $15 or less."

7/2/2017	Amazon	3	"It trims fine, but the attachments aren't that great"	"It trims fine, but the attachments aren't that great. The nose hair trimmer is unusable. It's flat with sharp edges and a little too wide to use without scratching your nostrils."
7/2/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Not good. Stopped working won't charge. Hasn't even been 1 month
7/3/2017	Amazon	4	Decent.	"Difficult to shave down to the skin, doesn't seem to get those hairs. Works great otherwise. Battery is decent. Attachments are alright. Price is good."
7/3/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	It broke down/won't despite being used only once a month.
7/4/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great product. Works great.
7/5/2017	Amazon	5	Very very pleased!	This All-in-1 shaver does everything is says it will do. I have been using it a while. Stays charged but doesn't take too long to recharge.
7/5/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Battery failed after a couple of months and you can't use it while plugged into the socket.
7/6/2017	Amazon	1	A waste of money	This is not a good product. This product was only used twice and broke. I would not recommend this brand/type to anyone.
7/6/2017	Amazon	5	"Awesome shaver, useful attachments"	"Bought one in store long ago, sought this one out online as a replacement. Awesome shaver, useful attachments too"
7/6/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great
7/6/2017	Amazon	1	Disappointing	"Worked only on the first charge It didn't last for the second charge, Battery just died I am so disappointed, coz I thought I had a good brand in hand with a good price Won't buy from Remington again"
7/6/2017	Amazon	1	Didn't last the month	"I used this razor a collective 10 times, then it decided to stop working. It also stopped taking a charge. Even before this problem occurred, the motor sounded dull and not as powerful as other razors I've purchased from different brands. Steer clear of this dud."
7/7/2017	Amazon	5	Long battery!	Perfect for keeping my beard trimmed and clean looking. Battery lasts FOREVER! the only complaint I have is the plastic guard that is the select a size gets clogged easily and has to be cleaned out while trimming if I am cutting my whole beard.

7/7/2017	Amazon	5	Will not recharge	Purchased this in April 2017. Worked fine for 2 months but now will not recharge. Not worth the hassle or expense to return under 2 year warranty.  8-6-2017 Upgraded review to 5 stars. Contacted Remington and they are sending me the new model PG6170 and a prepaid label to return the defective unit. Remington has great customer service . Tom Klank

In fact it is far better than several I have had over the years that cost far more. Very powerful, great attachments and very well made.  Lithium batter was fully charged on arrival and many uses later still as powerful and haven't yet charged it. To those that say it can't trim a longer beard I say try turning it around, it only works in one direction!  It took mine, thick beard hair,  down three inches like a knife through butter."
7/8/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Nice price on cordless set.
7/9/2017	Amazon	4	Good set	"WOW I thought at the beginning to return it since my barber shop guy told me this is not the one I needed, but it has exactly what I need, which is maintain the beard low like at #2, and this machine has #1, #2, ... Found yah! :D  I don't give it 5 stars because of the power, for the price I was expecting it to be more powerful, the rotation is not too strong, but does a nice work"
7/9/2017	Amazon	1	NOT a good gift!	"Do not buy this item as a gift!! The window for return is only 30 days so if you buy it in advance and your man doesn't want it, you're stuck!!!"
7/9/2017	Amazon	1	Trash. Would not recommend.	This battery doesn't work after 2 months of use. Can't even use it when it's plugged in. After less than 10 uses it basically doesn't work anymore. Trash. Would not recommend.
7/10/2017	Amazon	5	"Great for traveling, thanks for the fast delivery"	"This was perfect and something that I would use and buy for myself, but I bought this as a Father-in-law gift who travels a lot. And he loves it."

7/12/2017	Amazon	1	DEAD -- Used once	"I have had this for just over a month,  used once.  I went to use it for a second time (fully charged) and it will not work.  The charge light is illuminated but it is junk."
7/13/2017	Amazon	1	Nasty	Absolutely disgusting. You can see hairs inside the package without opening the box. Nasty nasty nasty. I will send this product back.
7/13/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Love it!
7/13/2017	Amazon	5	Happy trimming!	This combination trimmer shaver and nose hair trimmer is really nice. I can't tell you how many of the cheap type trimmers I've been through. I also like the way the head gets removed to put on another accessory. As well as the way the foil comes off so that you can clean them. It's very nice not to have to mess with batteries. It charges super quickly too. Very powerful easy to use and best of all feels very good in the hand.
7/14/2017	Amazon	2	Like most beard trimmers	"Like most beard trimmers, this one doesn't trim a beard well. The close shave head works well, but that's about it. I've tried many beard trimmers, and this is the same dumb design that catches no hair and takes an hour to do a simple job as all of the others- besides Wahl razors. Wahl is the only good one I've found."
7/14/2017	Amazon	5	Great travel accessory	Great travel accessory
7/14/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Battery is really bad on the product
7/15/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	"Very poor quality, not worth it trying it, buy different brand"
7/15/2017	Amazon	5	Love it! Came on time as described and works ...	Love it! Came on time as described and works great this my second one the first lasted about two years and it has been around the world with me. Glad to have a new setup.
7/15/2017	Amazon	3	Great trimmer for the price point	Great trimmer for the price point. I just purchased my third one. I keep purchasing this one because it is cheaper than most replacement heads for more expensive trimmers. It cuts hair great for about a year and half then will start to dull like any other trimmer. If this trimmer sold affordable replacement heads it would be the worlds best trimmer hands down!!
7/16/2017	Amazon	3	Too Narrow to be useful	"This product does not cut very close.  Its a cheep product for a cheep price.  The head is extremely narrow, that's why they don't tell you how wide the actual cutting surface is."
7/17/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Compact quiet and cuts hair wonderfully
7/17/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Hardly used the trimmer and it just stopped working.
7/17/2017	Amazon	4	"For the price, Worth it!"	"Got this as a gift for my father. He's used to borrowing my Wahl Detailers which is more expensive than this and does prefer the Detailers over this, but for the price, this was a GREAT purchase."
7/17/2017	Amazon	5	great tool	perfect for grooming
7/17/2017	Amazon	2	It is hard to really evaluate the trimmer. It ...	"It is hard to really evaluate the trimmer. It was marked as delivered last night, but there was nothing delivered in the place it was supposed to be. My big gripe is that there seems to be no way to directly contact Amazon to find out what is really going on or to ask for some redress. Is there any way to be in touch with a real person at Amazon?"
7/17/2017	Amazon	5	Nice cut	really like it soo far used once and they cut very good
7/18/2017	Amazon	2	Broke in 31 days.	This groomer broke 2 days after the eligible return date; 31 days after I received it. I am not a happy customer.
7/18/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great and cuts like a gem.
7/18/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Nice kit.
7/18/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	A highly useful product.
7/18/2017	Amazon	3	"Works ok, but no instructions"	Gave only 3 stars because no instructions came and need to fringed out how to attach the various attachments.
7/18/2017	Amazon	1	"apparently sellers like this, just repackage used RAZORS"	"I always wondered what happend to returned products. apparently sellers like this, just repackage used RAZORS!!.. The box looked brand new.. opened the box and two of the attachments and the main piece was full of hair.. This could have been used to shave someones butt then returned. there could be thousands of viruses / bacteria on this thing.. SUPER SUPER disgusting and dangerous."
7/18/2017	Amazon	1	Broke within 2 months - battery doesn't charge.	Broke within 2 months - battery doesn't charge.

7/19/2017	Amazon	5	Great trimmer	Well made with different attachments. Charges fast and lasts a few trims. Highly recommend.
7/19/2017	Amazon	1	... included attachments but the battery capacity makes this trimmer useless as a cordless	I thought this was very impressive with all the included attachments but the battery capacity makes this trimmer useless as a cordless. A cheap knock-off trimmer you should stay away from...Garbage.??
7/19/2017	Amazon	5	Great product	"I have never had luck with electric ""shavers"". The shaver attachment gives a very close shave. The grooming attachments do their job very well. Glad I purchased this."
7/19/2017	Amazon	5	Excellent. You can tell Remington takes pride in its ...	"My second Remington, so I knew what to expect. Excellent. You can tell Remington takes pride in its consumer products."
7/19/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Thanks!
7/19/2017	Amazon	4	Stand is Flimsy	"If you're between razors and are looking at this because it has a stand, don't let that sway you. The razor works great, but the stand is flimsy."
7/19/2017	Amazon	1	"So so clipper, horrible power system, dead after a few uses."	"So I got this unit because it was battery powered and rechargable. Great. That is until I relied on it to actually charge.  The first time I went to charge the unit the light came on and seemed to charge the battery. Great. After about an hour the light went off. I assumed it was done charging.  I used the clipper until the battery ran out. I then went to charge it up again and the light didn't come on. Ok, so maybe the light burned out. Right? Kind of crappy after one use, but whatever. So I left it in the charger for an hour like last time, unplugged it, and after turning it on I got about 15 seconds of run time out of it before it died.  I used a multimeter to check the charger and it was indeed dead. Pretty bad if you ask me.  I ordered a replacement charging unit with similar specs to the factory one, and after plugging in the clipper, the light came back on and I thought all was well.  After charging for a coupe of hours I tried to run the clipper and got a whopping 30 seconds of runtime out if it. Seems like the battery died too.  So after a handful of uses and a couple charge attempts, the factory charger died and the battery is gone. Pretty useless now considering that the clipper won't run off just the charger alone. Maybe one day I'll open it up to see how hard it is to replace the battery. It looks to be a 3.2v 600mah AA style battery. Should be fairly easy to replace.  Bottom line though is that this isn't something I should have to do this early into owning it. I have a 15 year old rechargable sonicare toothbrush that still holds a charge. Pretty sad in Remington's part.  When this thing worked, it worked pretty well, but I'd have to say steer clear to anybody looking at purchasing this thing. Maybe go find one that uses standard AA batteries or something."
7/19/2017	Amazon	1	Never took/held a charge	"I purchased this for my husband as his other trimmer was not keeping a charge. He opened this one and plugged it in. He tried to use it the next day and it would not work. He plugged it back in, as it should work directly plugged into the wall, and still nothing.  This razor never turned on directly out of the box. I usually wonder about these ""it arrived dead"" reviews when there are so many five stars, but now I will pay attention and think twice before purchasing if someone says it is a dud."
7/19/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	ok
7/20/2017	Amazon	5	Need this so bad and they work just like described	"Thanks.  Need this so bad and they work just like described.  Now everyone in my family want one, I told them where I got it and told them to buy there own.  Thanks."
7/20/2017	Amazon	5	Works Great	Great trimmer for the money. All the attachments work as they should with no pulling. Make sure it's fully charged.
7/20/2017	Amazon	3	Yea so about this...	"I bought this with very low expectations. I obviously bought it for the price. I do occasional grooming and I prefer to look scruffy. The lady's like the stubble on my chiseled jaw line. However it looks cheap, feels cheap and is very low powered. I bought to replace a cheap wall beard trimmer that used 2 AA battteries. That 10 year old trimmer works circles around this one. I won't be returning it because I did use it so manscape. I'll use it and continue to be a scruffy looking nerf herder."
7/20/2017	Amazon	1	how come goes bad so soon	"Purchased, within 6 weeks battery not recharging, Build in recharge battery, how come goes bad so soon,"
7/21/2017	Amazon	1	Too light and small	"Don't waste your money on this product.  Might work well for trimming, but lousy for a complete haircut."
7/21/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Works well.
7/21/2017	Amazon	5	Awesome !!!	I got this to trim my beard and mustache and it works well.
7/21/2017	Amazon	4	The razor works well the only concern is the attachment ...	The razor works well the only concern is the attachment that enables one to shave your beard at different lengths. My concern after multiple uses would be it might fail since it appears to be made somewhat flimsy.
7/21/2017	Amazon	1	I like the appearance of just above a five oclock shadow ...	"The smallest trim attachment leaves you wanting more.  I cannot tell if its even cutting, I like the appearance of just above a five oclock shadow and this razor will not even get close to that point.  I'm a scruffy mess!!"
7/22/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Good Product...!
7/22/2017	Amazon	1	Almost Nothing But Trash	Let's just say that this is absolutely terrible to be nice. Bought it because it says head to toe but it literally makes me bleed a little every 10 or so strokes. All its useful for now is the trimmer with the gaurd for shortening hair.
7/22/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	AWESOME!
7/22/2017	Amazon	5	Remington PG6025 Cordless Razor	Good product. Handles real well.
7/22/2017	Amazon	2	The trimmer was nice when it was working	The trimmer was nice when it was working.  I used it mainly to trim my beard.  Unfortunately after 5 months it stopped working.  I will buy another trimmer but not from Remington this time around.
7/22/2017	Amazon	4	Good but needs a closer comb attachment.	"Well enough made but I am a little disappointed with the attachments, specifically the smallest of the three snap-on adjustable combs doesn't reach close enough to properly trim the depth of my beard (goatee). Other than that, it's a keeper."
7/22/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	works good does the job
7/23/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	It's cheap wouldn't waste my money on it
7/23/2017	Amazon	3	OK Shaver	"This is a very good device, but it war returned due to the nose trimmer attachment being too sharp and painful to use."
7/23/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	does a fine job; priced right.
7/23/2017	Amazon	5	"Works perfectly, as promised."	"Works perfectly, as promised. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again."
7/24/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Works great, perfect trimmer, no complaints."
7/24/2017	Amazon	5	Won't hurt your goods	"I have used these to shave just about every part of my body as some point. This is the only electric shaver that I have ever used where I didn't have to worry about cutting  ""the boys"" before I made my way out for date night. The blades never seem to dull and I love how I can rinse them off in the sink before I switch two a new body part. Keep up the good work, Remington!"
7/24/2017	Amazon	5	So far so good	I purchased this for my 13 year old son who is starting to need to clean up around the jawline and just trim around the upper lip. So far so good.
7/24/2017	Amazon	4	Works Great	My boyfriend likes this shaver.  He said it works nicely and I say it gives him a nice shave.  The battery lasts a long time. All the attachments work nicely.  I would recommend this to anyone.
7/24/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Fantastic little trimmer. It has a couple great attachments.
7/24/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Just bought this is May and it has died already havent used that many times
7/24/2017	Amazon	4	Decent product	"Good product.  Had issues from the cheaper models with the battery just giving out, hopefully this one doesn't do the same."
7/25/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	very useful
7/25/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Stopped working after around 2 months. Got a replacement and same thing happened.
7/25/2017	Amazon	1	Piece of junk	It takes 5 hours to charge the device and then you get 15 minutes of power once fully charged. Device stopped working after 1 year of use.
7/25/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Horrible. Broke2 months after purchase. Don't buy!
7/26/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	SHAVES WELL
7/26/2017	Amazon	5	Works great!	My husband loves it and it works great!
7/26/2017	Amazon	4	Worked as intended	Has plenty of attachments.
7/26/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Easy to use and nice on the touch.
7/26/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	I like it but it is work only 110v not 220v
7/26/2017	Amazon	1	Rechargeable battery used in the products seems to be of bad quality. Stay away and don't waste your money	The trimmer is not charging any more. Used only twice. Rechargeable battery used in the products seems to be of bad quality. Stay away and don't waste your money.
7/26/2017	Amazon	5	... shave one side of my head and it works great! The battery lasts a long time	I use it to shave one side of my head and it works great! The battery lasts a long time. For the price and the way it works is worth it! I even convinced my boyfriend to want to get one for himself. He uses it for its intended use.
7/26/2017	Amazon	1	Don't waste your money	Doesn't work any better than my 20+ year old norelco shaver.  Had to go back and use a regular 99 cent store disposable razor to finish the job.  Got a neater line up with only slightly more work.
7/26/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"This shaved is perfect, it is quiet during operation and gives a level shave, suitable for gifts."
7/26/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Use it all the time easy to pack and take on the road

7/27/2017	Amazon	5	Great product!	Works great!
7/27/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Very nice, easy to use"
7/28/2017	Amazon	1	"Battery Problems, Would NOT Recommend"	"Like a lot of people here who gave bad reviews, the one I bought had battery problems. The battery no longer charges when I plug it in, after only 3 months of use. Even when it did work, it seemed like a fairly low quality product. My beard is not very thick at all, yet I had to go over the same spot numerous times to trim all of the hairs."
7/28/2017	Amazon	5	Great product	This works wonders!!! I bought this for my husband and he loves it!! He's learned how to trim no cut his beard himself!!
7/28/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Very nice grooming set up
7/29/2017	Amazon	3	Three Stars	Wish it had more length adjust options.
7/29/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	It was a gift and he loved it.
7/29/2017	Amazon	5	Perfect beard trimmer	Best beard trimmer I have owned and I have had a beard for 41 years.
7/30/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	exelent
7/30/2017	Amazon	2	Ear and nose hair attachment sucks..	Battery dies quick. Ear and nose hair attachment sucks...seriously THE WORST.
7/30/2017	Amazon	5	Pretty Good.	"At first i thought it was a cheap product and by that i meant the tools and the stand but i went to work with it immediately. I like it a lot. Its smooth, not loud. very effective. Great for the price. It has everything i personally need. i have only had it for an hour so far and used everything. It has a two year warranty and thats long enough for what i paid. 25 bucks. Thanks"
7/30/2017	Amazon	1	Junk!!	Used it 2 times and it will not turn on again. There is a green light when I plug it in but doesn't work.
7/31/2017	Amazon	1	Save your money.	Junk. Can't even trim sideburns with bare blade. Won't cut hair at all. Gave it one star because you can't leave zero.
7/31/2017	Amazon	3	They work great for the price and the instructions were ready to ...	They work great  for the price and the instructions were ready to follow and understand.  Only drawback is that the charge doesn't last very long.
7/31/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	LOve this little all purpose trimmer...
7/31/2017	Amazon	5	Love it. For my son's birthday	"Love it.  For my son's birthday.  Very nice, has a handy pouch to keep it all together. Very nice."
7/31/2017	Amazon	5	Great!	Great product! Works perfect! AAA+
8/1/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Worked great for five days. Then it stopped completel. Very disappointing.
8/1/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	I am so please of this product
8/1/2017	Amazon	1	"marketing on product looks great, only it doesn't work.."	never worked.. junk.
8/2/2017	Amazon	3	"its ok, but not great"	Its not bad but certainly not as good as the Remington model it was meant to replace. It just doesn't seem as powerful and the battery doesn't seem to last as long.
8/3/2017	Amazon	2	This would be a good razor if the entire end of it didn't heat ...	This would be a good razor if the entire end of it didn't heat up to the point where it'll burn you after being switched on for two minutes
8/3/2017	Amazon	5	Great Value	This is my second one... I like it so much I have one at my home and one for my winter place.
8/3/2017	Amazon	3	Three Stars	To small for practical shaving
8/3/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	What a time and money saver.  We don't have to go to the stylist now!
8/4/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"love the versatility, and the quality is excellent, I am so pleased i purchased this item.."
8/4/2017	Amazon	4	Shaver	"This item was purchased as a gift.  According to the receiver,  he loves it, and will use it for years to come."
8/4/2017	Amazon	5	My husband forgot hid razor when we left for an ...	My husband forgot hid razor when we left for an extended trip. And his beard was getting awful! So looked and found this on Amazon at very reasonable price.  He really likes it - as much as the more expensive one he forgot to bring!  Gives it 5 stars without hesitation!
8/4/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Good for the price
8/5/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Works fine so far.  Have only used it 3 tmes
8/6/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	"Didn't have a lot of power, took a long time to trim down my facial hair"
8/6/2017	Amazon	5	What's not to like?	"Between the 3 combs and the 2mm increments with the adjustable attachment, you have about as much precision as you can get.  Add in the nose hair trimmer and foil attachment and you have yourself the best shaver you can get for the price - plus the battery lasts forever.  This is by far the best combo shaver I've ever owned."
8/6/2017	Amazon	2	Battery Failure after 2.5 Months	It was good for the first 2.5 months but the the battery started holding less and less charge over the course of the last 2 weeks. Now it doesn't hold charge at all and only works for half a second when plugged in. There are many other razors that are better than this one.
8/6/2017	Amazon	1	Only lasted 4 months!	I really liked this trimmer set when I first got it. The problem is it just died at exactly 4 months old. It won't even turn on. You might want to look for something made a lot better than this one.
8/6/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great product and a great price.
8/7/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great product for how inexpensive it is.
8/7/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Love it! Great Price!

8/7/2017	Amazon	5	he loved it!	"Gave to my husband as a gift, he loved it!"
8/8/2017	Amazon	3	Three Stars	Kinda good
8/8/2017	Amazon	1	Fool me once	"I bought my trimmer just 7 months ago, and now it won't hold a charge. You got me once Remington... it won't happen again"
8/8/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	works great!
8/8/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Works great!
8/8/2017	Amazon	3	Some attachments are not that useful	"Regular trimmer/clipper and shaver attachments work fine. Compact body size is handy. The narrow detail trimmer attachment, which is one of the reasons I bought this set, is pretty much useless. It is not effective at actually cutting hair, and it's difficult to position it correctly to do the trimming. The body trimmer attachment also does not seem to be very effective, but I don't plan to use it."
8/8/2017	Amazon	3	Three Stars	after 3 months the battery stopped holding a charge
8/8/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	"Died quickly, do not buy"
8/8/2017	Amazon	5	Works great.	I purchased the Remington kit to replace an older Wahl unit that I have had for years and it cuts much cleaner then my old unit.
8/8/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	I like this product it easy to use and works great
8/9/2017	Amazon	2	Try a different brand.	Not very effective on chest hair.
8/9/2017	Amazon	2	The trimmer is excellent quality though	Shaving head doesn't shave anything (it works but doesn't shave). The trimmer is excellent quality though.
8/10/2017	Amazon	4	also you better not drink too much coffee before using this	"bretty gud.  although as I've come to expect with ANY trimmer/shaver under $100, the foil shaver is worthless.  also you better not drink too much coffee before using this, very easily causes cuts, especially without an attachment on the tip."
8/10/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Perfect use for all around shaving!
8/10/2017	Amazon	5	The best body trimmer i have ever used	The best body trimmer i have ever used! It's amazing! It does the job as i expected! Very satisfied with this purchase.

8/11/2017	Amazon	2	Works well but breaks quicly	"When it worked, it gave a nice shave, but the battery stopped charging after 6 months of use."
8/11/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	No longer holds a charge less than 1 month in.
8/11/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Very professional and high quality product!
8/11/2017	Amazon	5	Great product	"After owning for a couple of months the battery and product holds up well with no issues. The carrying bag is convenience to have everything in one spot and easy for travel. Would definitely recommend to another person, well worth the price."
8/11/2017	Amazon	5	Works great. At first was unsure if it would last	"Works great. At first was unsure if it would last, but it's a nice solid build. The nose/hair trimmer and the facial hair trimmer work great. Easy green light indicator for fully charged. several connections for vairous trims"
8/11/2017	Amazon	1	Really did like it maybe a just got a bad one from ...	Wife got me this 3 weeks ago and it stopped working couldn't get it replace because she used a friend's account only used it twice a week so a total of 6 times and done! Really did like it maybe a just got a bad one from the factory!
8/11/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Good product
8/11/2017	Amazon	3	Three Stars	There are better products than this.
8/11/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	My husband loves it
8/12/2017	Amazon	1	Bad product	"This is a very bad product, even Chinese products are useful than this rubbish! it worked only till the battery needed to be charged, but while putting it on the charger for 3 hours, it worked 10 seconds only and stopped, tried many times without any response. bad bad bad, don't buy it."
8/12/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Great product, just wish there were more attachments haha"
8/12/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	"Does not work properly at all, wont cut any hair.  Pros - nothing. Cons - everything."
8/12/2017	Amazon	1	Not for detailed grooming.	Trims beard well with height adapter but does not cut beard stubble on face at all. Nor will it cut defined lines on goatee or side burns. Seems that the teeth are not fine enough to grab the hair.
8/12/2017	Amazon	5	This product is very useful and versatile	This is the second Remington trimmer I have purchased.  One I left with my old roommate and the other I have.  I keep my head shaved as close as the Remington allows for.  This product is very useful and versatile.  Good item.
8/13/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	All the right attachments.
8/13/2017	Amazon	5	A great and useful tool.	"A fine product, very versatile, I'm very pleased."
8/13/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	works well so far  inexpensive too

8/14/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Good
8/15/2017	Amazon	1	Dissatisfied	Extremely disappointed with this product. Functioned well for a few weeks then stopped working entirely. Complete waste of time and money.
8/15/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Nice item.
8/15/2017	Amazon	2	Not for cutting Head hair.	"Do not purchase this thinking you might trim the hair on your head. It simply won't do that. The attachment might work for a beard, but in no way will cut my hair. Worthless."
8/15/2017	Amazon	5	Great razor	I've had many electric razors and this is one of my favorites its better then my 60 dollar razor it comes with many heads id 100 percent recommend this
8/15/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Very nice. Small and light weight. Easy to handle.
8/16/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Can't beat the price, has every attachment you could want for beard shaping and manscaping!"
8/17/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Broke after 2nd time I used it...
8/17/2017	Amazon	5	Great product. Have no complaints	"Great product.  Have no complaints, quick and easy."
8/17/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	i had this for 7 months and it stopped working i think it should work longer than that.
8/18/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	"Good unit, the nose trimmer sucks, but everything else is good"
8/18/2017	Amazon	1	Don't buy it! Junk!	Stopped working two weeks after purchase! Will not power on at all even though lights up when charging. Junk and apparently I missed the return option by 4 days!! Very unhappy! Don't waste your money
8/18/2017	Amazon	2	Not close enough of a shave	The unit seems sturdy and not having an overabundance of attachments to clutter the drawer was nice.  However for my uses this product wasn't very good.  I like to keep a 2-3 day growth and use the trimmer with no attachment to get areas around my chin and upper lip.  This wouldn't do that.  I charged it for a day to make sure it wasn't that.  This might be a good option if you keep your beard longer but for me it wasn't what I was after.  My previous trimmer did the job but i lost the power cable and figured 5 years was time for a new one anyway.  If you like to keep a your beard very short this won't do it.
8/18/2017	Amazon	1	It broke during first use	It stopped working properly halfway through the first use.  Luckily I registered it with Remington.  I contacted them and they are sending me a newer model of the same product.  Hopefully it doesn't break like its predecessor.
8/18/2017	Amazon	5	This is great for men with beards	"This is great for men with beards. The different lengths help keep my beard tidy and professional looking. The other heads are very useful in eliminating my ""spotty"" sideburns. The pouch makes it very easy to travel with."
8/18/2017	Amazon	5	Your man will love this	Great item! My husband absolutely loves this thing. Isn't cheap or bad quality and the different pieces are really easy to change
8/19/2017	Amazon	3	Three Stars	Good
8/19/2017	Amazon	1	Not at all satisfied. Used it a couple of times and next ...	"Not at all satisfied. Used it a couple of times and next time after charging it doesn't work. You keep sliding the button up or down, it doesn't work. Bought it as it was advertised as Best Seller on Amazon but really disappointed with the reliability of this product"
8/19/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	"Stopped working after first charge. Does not charge, only used it once."
8/20/2017	Amazon	5	Good trimmer	Works like a profectional one . Charging it i read it takes  24 hr. But all 3 green lights were on in 2 hrs .  It Came charged
8/20/2017	Amazon	1	"You had one job, trimmers. One."	"I bought this for one purpose - to shave the back of my neck every few days. Sounds like a simple matter, right? NOPE! It doesn't touch the stubble at all, even if it's a good quarter-inch long. I've used the foil as well as the unguarded clippers, and nothing. Curious if it trims anything at all, I took it to my arm hair (which is much finer than my neck hair.) After a couple of passes, it managed to clear some of the hair, but nothing like what I would expect.  As one might expect from the price, it is very, very cheaply made. This has the plus of it being nice and light, but it's otherwise useless.  The only nice thing I can say about it is that it holds a charge well."
8/21/2017	Amazon	5	all ok!	"Good product, conforms to the description"
8/21/2017	Amazon	1	"for the price its a great buy, but real happy with this product"	"for the price its a great buy, but real happy with this product. It doesn't work as well as my old one."
8/21/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great replacement for my last clippers. BUy THESE you'll love them.
8/22/2017	Amazon	5	Awesome trimmer!	This thing works great. Holds its charge and charges fast. Love the attachments. At this price point its hard to beat. Quality is there too.
8/22/2017	Amazon	5	Perfect!	Exactly what I wanted! Works great! Looks good! Easy to use! Cheap! You'd think I was getting paid to advertise this stuff!
8/22/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Very responsible seller, the quality of the product is impressive as the presentation where it comes."
8/22/2017	Amazon	5	Some deal	Aswsome price worth it
8/22/2017	Amazon	1	Broken within 4 months	"Hi guys,  I'm sorry to write a bad review, but I got this four months ago and it's already broken. Not sure if it's the razor or the charger but it's just died. I plug it in, but even after I charge it, it putters out. Am I able to yet a refund or a replacement? If so, I will remove this review."
8/22/2017	Amazon	1	Need to hit it to get the thing to turn on and sucks at cutting	Junk!!! Need to hit it to get the thing to turn on and sucks at cutting hair
8/23/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	It is useful
8/23/2017	Amazon	5	love it	love it
8/23/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great
8/23/2017	Amazon	3	Good but....	The product was good and work well but it has only three different lenght of cut for the bird.
8/23/2017	Amazon	1	Repulsive! Hair found in product sold as new!	"Product was sold as new, but had hair inside and on parts. Absolutely disgusting. Returning this bio-hazard ASAP."
8/24/2017	Amazon	5	Wow! Do I have any hair left?	"Power, sharp, and compact. Only complaint is the tray...rather see a bag included... but not enough concern to take away a star...."
8/24/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	bad battery
8/24/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Nice shaver and like all of the attachments. Great price.
8/24/2017	Amazon	2	Not nearly as good of a trimmer as I expected.	Bought this during Amazon Prime Week because it was on sale. Not the best trimmer. Used it once and thought it was a complete waste of money. One of the heads arrived broken (I understand that's a shipping issue more than anything) and the trimmer simply would not grab hair. I was planning on using it mostly to clean up the neck hair under my beard but it couldn't even grab that. I ended up purchasing a PEANUT which is by far one of the best trimmers I have used.
8/24/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works good. Came charged.
8/25/2017	Amazon	5	Good buy.	Pretty good. Good price. Has everything needed to groom.
8/26/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great
8/27/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Light duty. More of a mustash trimer.
8/27/2017	Amazon	5	Great razor	"This is a good razor, I have purchased three simply because the price is right and I didn't want to run the risk of not being able to get it again.  I use it to keep my hair buzzed and to maintain my beard no complaints.  I have been using this product for almost a year now."
8/27/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	nice trimmer but the muststache trimming guards are not very well constructed.
8/27/2017	Amazon	3	plus doesnt give me as close of a shave as i would like!	"Makes me very itchy, plus doesnt give me as close of a shave as i would like!"
8/27/2017	Amazon	5	Awesome trimmer	"Awesome trimmer! I cut my husband's hair and it's perfect for trimming around sideburns, neck, and ears."
8/28/2017	Amazon	1	what a waste of money	"Beware, Beware, Beware, Do not buy this trimer, It stop working suddenly, what a waste of money, why would you spend money on a product that dies or breaks in a few month with very little use. I am not sure if I could even get my money back."
8/28/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Best item for its price group. Way better then even slightly more expensive ones from Wal Mart
8/29/2017	Amazon	5	Lets go	"Holds a charge , the last one didn"
8/29/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	I wish it came with a stand to put it in instead of a bag.
8/30/2017	Amazon	1	Worked for 3 months then quit working.	"Bought on June 1, 2017, worked great for 3 months (used once a week). Went to use it on August 29th and it was dead.  I plugged it in over night thinking maybe battery was dead, but it will not turn on. I would not recommend this product."
8/30/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Very good quality and love to use this on my beard and around my ears too.
8/30/2017	Amazon	3	Three Stars	This is not a hair cutter. It is about half the size of a Wahl.
8/31/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	The battery stopped working after 2 months. Save your money
8/31/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	The battery will not hold a charge
9/1/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	good product thank you.
9/1/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	works well!
9/1/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	The machine stopped working after 1 month. Awful
9/1/2017	Amazon	1	Do not buy	"Terrible product. I've charged it for over 12 hrs, followed all instructions, and still has not turned on. There is also hair inside of the trimmer, as if it has already been used. Completely disgusting and a total waste of money."
9/2/2017	Amazon	2	"Good seller, poor product."	"Do not buy! Poor quality product. Worst electric shaver I have ever owned. I rarely post poor reviews, so let that be a warning. Takes me 6x longer to shave than my old one. Eventually got frustrated and reached for the razors/shaving cream. The shipping was wonderful though! Good seller, poor product."
9/2/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Works fine
9/2/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great and has a long battery life.
9/2/2017	Amazon	5	Great find	This is the second similar brand of beard trimmer that I've purchased.  This one is by far my favorite with better ergononomics and plenty of accessories to get the job done.
9/2/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	a great trimming tool
9/2/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	works well except for nose hair trimmer
9/2/2017	Amazon	2	It's so cheaply made - sort of like a toy hair trimmer set	It's so cheaply made - sort of like a toy hair trimmer set. I was afraid I'd break it the first time I cut and trimmed my husband's hair. Wouldn't recommend except that it was very inexpensive. You get what you pay for and all that:) ~ Penny
9/2/2017	Amazon	1	Not A Quality Product	I bought this product not from amazon but still the same product. I had it a total of 3 months before the battery completely died and wouldn't charge or even work with the charger attached to it.
9/2/2017	Amazon	3	Stopped holding a charge	It was an OK trimmer but died within a year.
9/2/2017	Amazon	2	Two Stars	"This has a tendency to push the hair instead of cutting it, not very effective as a beard trimmer."
9/3/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Works great. Charge lasts a long time.
9/4/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Good product!!
9/4/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Hasn't had any issues anf gives a clean facial shave

9/4/2017	Amazon	1	Lasted about 6 months	"Bought it february 17, and it died for good last month August 17"
9/5/2017	Amazon	5	Good trimmer.	"Lasts a lot longer between charges than my old trimmer, works great."
9/5/2017	Amazon	2	Spend the extra cash on a better product	"It starts off quiet and smooth but the battery and the longevity of this device is WEAK SAUCE...  I have only had it for a few months and it's already internally deteriorating faster than a mummy's insides. Don't buy it, the green lights dont even let you know how much battery is left."
9/5/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	perfect
9/5/2017	Amazon	4	"This product met my needs, I was dis-appointed in ..."	"This product met my needs, I was dis-appointed in the small trimmer head that comes with it.  That would be because the smaller head is not convenient to trim nose hair and may cause you to sneeze when doing so."
9/5/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great price works well.
9/5/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Can't beat it for the price. I have 2 if them.

The trimmers themselves are good working but the guards are a terrible design and do not let the hair pass to the blades. I can use these for zero guard but if you want to actually trim to a preferred height. Keep looking because these are not for you.
9/6/2017	Amazon	2	Two Stars	the adjustable combs are useless.
9/6/2017	Amazon	3	Three Stars	It wasn't as easy to use.

9/8/2017	Amazon	4	"I bought mine about 4 years ago, still works ..."	"I bought mine about 4 years ago, still works well, use it every day because work doesn't really allow for facial hair. Only have to charge it every couple of weeks or so."
9/8/2017	Amazon	5	Works well	"Love it. Works well and rarely needs charging. I have always used Remington trimmers and have had no problems. The old heads from my older trimmer fits on this trimmer, also."
9/8/2017	Amazon	5	Excellent.	Excellent upgrade for me.
9/9/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	I have this brand and model since 4 years - got this one ordered for a friend
9/9/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Excelent for the body
9/10/2017	Amazon	5	Get this razor	This works perfectly. It's a great price and comes with a variety of options. Battery holds a good charge and works while plugged in. It gives a great shave and trim.
9/10/2017	Amazon	5	Shave anyone!!	Came as described. Very nice product for a first one to own for a teenage boy. Nice variety of tools with it.
9/10/2017	Amazon	4	Good trimmer	"Works pretty good. The detail trimmer works decently. Could be better, but all in all is pretty good. I'll keep it. F*** it"
9/11/2017	Amazon	5	and easy to hold	"These clippers are small, lightweight, and easy to hold. Some really useful attachments are included. Some of the attachments are not effective, but the ones that do work make this trimmer a great value. It is easy to clean, easy to use, and easy to hold."
9/11/2017	Amazon	5	I love it.	I love it.
9/11/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	works like a champ!

9/12/2017	Amazon	1	THIS ONE IS GOING BACK! KEEPING MY PG-350	"Having a beard and trimmers for many years I had a reaction when I opened this one up. Yuck! - It's going back.  A couple things I noticed right off the bat. The standard hair trimming blade is enormous!  My old Remington PG-350 was just a tad over 3/4"" This one over 1-1/4"" long! Not real practical for cutting in small tight areas.  I also noted that the blades (stationary and moving) don't come together very close at the end like my old Remington. My old Remington PG-350 was great at trimming stubble off my neck area. I'm sure the Lithium powered would be great over my Ni-Cad but honestly my old trimmer is not used that long and I just keep it constantly plugged in. Blessings, John 20:29"
9/12/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great. Powerful and get a nice close shave on the face
9/13/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Thought it was full sized for hair trimming. It works well for body hair though.
9/13/2017	Amazon	1	horrible quality stand	"body part leaves a 4th inch, dies quickly, horrible quality stand, not a stand charger"
9/13/2017	Amazon	4	Not bad	Not the best so not giving 5 stars. It's pretty handy to have at home specially if you have a 4 members in a household needing haircuts every once in a while. Not too powerful but gets the job done.
9/13/2017	Amazon	5	Definitely upgrade if you're using a clipper with a cord.	"Finally upgraded from my old model with a cord. Can't believe I didn't do it sooner! The product is super easy to use, attachments all come off and on pretty easily and its pretty sharp.  Only thing, slightly disappointed by is that it didn't come with a cleaning brush, kind of expected that to be included but seems you need to buy it separately. Still five stars anyway. It's great and I have another brush anyway."
9/13/2017	Amazon	3	First impression isn't great but I will say that after using the clippers ...	"First impression isn't great but I will say that after using the clippers they are okay with one exception, the clippers do not cut close  enough but I will over come and adjust ......on the upside this set was  not nearly as expensive as the ones they will replace."

9/14/2017	Amazon	1	Stopped working after a month	Useless product... Battery dead after a month...
9/14/2017	Amazon	3	... product is Ok for the price but I am disappointed that there seems to be no information on the ...	The product is Ok for the price but I am disappointed that there seems to be no information on the lithium battery care which is very disappointing. The only mention of the battery is how to dispose of it when it fails. There is no information on how long it takes to charge or if it is Ok to leave it on charge when it is not being used which is a little scary since lithium batteries can be dangerous if not treated right
9/14/2017	Amazon	5	Great Prooduct	What a great kit!  Serves at home & on the road.
9/14/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Like it
9/15/2017	Amazon	5	Works great and my battery works fine	"I don't use it everyday, but mine works great and my battery works fine.  No complaints."
9/15/2017	Amazon	1	Battery dead quickly	I bought this Trimmer 2 years ago and it worked for a year. Then it went dead. It showed it was  charging but it would not work after I  charged it. Then I bought another one and the same thing happened after 6 months. SO I will not but another one unless Remington can show me a trick to get a dead trimmer working again.
9/16/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Works great came in decent amount of time
9/16/2017	Amazon	4	Good stuff	Wish the guards cut more evenly. Otherwise great product.

Works great charges  fast lasts long I tried all attachments work  fine  the ear one I think the other cutter without the blade showing that is a  chrome circle design that  this one does not come  with  is a better  cutter this one  cuts but does not get the very  fine hairs  close enough over all  still a  great  purchase would i  recommend it yes I would even  purchase it again thank you.

9/18/2017	Amazon	4	Works great and holds its charge	Works great! Needs to be cleaned and oil more often than I'd expect but my hair could just be exceptionally thick or something.
9/18/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	really nice
9/18/2017	Amazon	2	Blades not sharp enough	The blades are not sharp enough to get a close cut nor does it trim well for the beard. Not recommended for African American men. Returning product.
9/18/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Good product
9/19/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	I love it!
9/19/2017	Amazon	3	Li-ion battery without a battery gauge is a no go.	"I bought this at a local store. The trimmer itself works great. I really have no complaints about how well cuts, but this is a Li-ion battery powered device. That, combined with its inability to run off the AC adaptor is where this falls apart.  Li-ion power is great, when it's treated right. Meaning not leaving the battery fully charged or discharged. Considering this is a device that uses a fraction of the available battery capacity at a time, the battery is very easily abused even when trying to treat it right. Most people are likely to charge this and then leave it sit for days on end at high charge levels. Then they'll use it until it's dead before charging again. Both of these have negative impacts on the battery. Without a battery gauge, you'll have no way to tell what the charge level is to keep it in the happy medium that Li-ion batteries need for long life. This wouldn't be a huge issue if you could still power the device with the power adaptor for when the battery completely dies and no longer holds a charge.  Granted, at $15, you can't expect the world. But as is, consider yourself lucky if you get even a full year of use out of it."
9/19/2017	Amazon	5	great	The battery seems to last forever. great product
9/19/2017	Amazon	4	Small works amazing and has good power	Small works amazing and has good power. The only one that didn't work was the body attachment one. Otherwise great product and excellent price

I have been using similar trimmer for the past 10 years but this absolutely did not work. I used it for trimming my beard and I think blades were really bad because it didnt trim evenlly and pulls hair instead of trimming. Anyway really dissapointed with the order.

9/20/2017	Amazon	4	I'm happy with it	Battery last a long time on a charge. Foil cutter is surprisingly good. Trims beard well. Only complaint is that the clipper by itself doesn't cut close enough for my liking.

9/22/2017	Amazon	2	Buyer Beware	This groomer was good for a few uses and then became useless. What used to take 10 mins now takes 40 because I have to keep going over the same spot to make sure all the hairs are trimmed properly.
9/22/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great stuff
9/22/2017	Amazon	5	Awesome little clipper	????
9/23/2017	Amazon	4	Low-tech. Kind of works for me!	"Have been growing a beard for two months. Want to keep it but make it look less unruly. Had seen a set-up like this before. Decided to buy this from Amazon. Unfortunately, instructions on how to attach all are excluded in the minimalist instruction booklet.  Try not to lose the plastic parts. You DO need to buy a little brush to keep the shaver clean.  Yep, works for me!"
9/23/2017	Amazon	2	"No oil, no brush, no comb included."	"I did not purchase this at Amazon. I purchased this at my local Wal-Mart where it was $2 more expensive than the current Amazon price. The base station is cheap and the items barely sit on top. One slight bump and everything scatters. The description states that this is easily to clean with water, but everyone knows if you do so you will have to re-lubricate any oiled parts. This is the only shaver I have ever purchased which did not come with the oil included. I double checked the instructions, and sure enough you will need to re-oil parts once a month. The instructions also state to clean the shaver parts with a brush to remove stray hairs, which is obvious and needs to be done with any shaver. However, again, a brush for this was not included. A hair comb is typically included as well with most groomers, but not in this kit. It would be so easy to include these three very cheap, but essential items, so I have no idea why Remington decided to leave them out. I already have these things from my old kit, but if you are looking for a starter kit for a teenager, please look elsewhere. I will be returning the two I purchased for myself and my son."
9/24/2017	Amazon	5	!00 % satisfied !	First got the shaver for my son-in-law  he was happy ! So I also bought one for myself .. excellent replacement for my battery electric shaver.
9/24/2017	Amazon	4	Good shaver and trimmer.	"I like it a lot, but the body hair trimmer guard shortest length is still too big for me and so it doesn't cut the short hair; if you don't have long body hair I recommend the PG6025, it would also get the job done and it's less expensive.  The PG525 version doesn't have a battery indicator, however battery life is splendid, have used it about 5 times and yet hasn't run out of power. The charge stand is a nice add on to have everything in place."

9/28/2017	Amazon	5	Highly Recommend	Works just as expected and the attachments that come with it are an amazing addition.
9/29/2017	Amazon	1	Don't buy this	It overheats to the point where you can barely touch your skin with it. The adjustable head breaks too easy  and a replacement cost $7.
9/29/2017	Amazon	5	Best ever	This is the best trimmer I have ever had and I have had a few of them!!!

9/30/2017	Amazon	4	Very efficient	I got this product for my brother and he really loves it! Its very light and the trimmers are very efficient. He uses it all the time and he doesnt have to go to the barber to get his beard trimmed. Saves money!!
9/30/2017	Amazon	1	Totally disappointed.	"After less than 35 days of use, the Remington PG6025 no longer charges the battery, even though the charging light indicates it. When it is supposed to be charged (after several hours connected), it does not even try to start. Totally dead. Totally disappointed."

10/2/2017	Amazon	1	CUTS MY SKIN	"I've had this for about a month and now it keeps cutting my skin. Not a tiny nick here and there, but like 3 - 5 painful lacerations. I was using it once a week and it has not been dropped, I'm the only one who uses it.  It's a piece of junk and I would return it if I could."
10/2/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	OK

10/3/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works perfectly! Battery charge lasts long
10/3/2017	Amazon	5	So far easy to use	So far easy to use...light weight with good power.  Easy to change one attachment to another!  For the money well worth it.
10/3/2017	Amazon	1	Skip it	All I can say is to confirm the 1 star reviews. This product is low quality. Battery just dies unreasonably quickly and you end up with a sorry ass treamer in less than a week. For $15 you wont get much.
10/3/2017	Amazon	5	Love it. Battery lasts for long period of time	"Love it. Battery lasts for long period of time. Actually, I charged it only once if it still works just fine. Pretty good product overall would? suggest."

10/9/2017	Amazon	5	Good trimmer	I really like this little trimmer. It comes with a variety of accessories so I can trim my nose and ear hair or trim the back of my neck. The different heads just twist off and on.

10/12/2017	Amazon	4	Works well	"So far, this is working well, and allows versatile uses."
10/12/2017	Amazon	5	reasonably priced for all your grooming needs	"I was looking for a reasonable priced groomer/shaver to replace a much more expensive one where the rechargeable batter had died.  This product was perfect for my needs.  I have no beard, mustache, and a stylist cuts my hair.  I purchased this specifically for manscaping.  I find that the charge is plenty for taking care of the armpits, groin and under, arms, and legs.  I have very sparse front torso hair so I don't usually worry about that other than just trimming whats there to the same length as what is immediately below for a uniform look.  This clipper performed exactly as I needed and expected.  It worked perfectly for the more sensitive areas.  I just use the lowest guard setting so it worked perfectly.  Of course when you are manscaping those areas you always want to do so carefully so as to avoid accidental nicks.  I don't store anything on my side of the counter but for those of you that do the stand is a very handy way to keep the groomer in one place conveniently located with all the attachments.  It also makes for a very easy way to transport them all at one time should you groom in a different locale that in front of the counter.  All in all I have been very pleased with this groomer and wished I had tried this one first before dropping the amount of money on the one this replaced."
10/13/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Good value
10/13/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Bought in Feb 2017 just stopped charging in Sept 2017. Probably used 6 times. Very disappointed
10/13/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	This works great
10/13/2017	Amazon	4	Why pay more???	"Excellent trimmer for a reasonable price. Long battery life, attachments are easy to install and secure (don't wiggle), won't slip out of hand in shower when wet, easy to remove attachments for cleaning, re-charges quickly. Hard to beat. Only complaint is minor - instructions could have been written better. I'd buy it again."
10/13/2017	Amazon	5	Works good	"Got two of these, one for boat the other for house. Lightweight easy to handle."
10/13/2017	Amazon	5	I have heavy facial hair and it cuts it real easy. 4	1. Cons  Cheap price $ 14.96 can`t beat it. 2. I use this clipper as a beard shaver when i do not want to actually shave with a razor. 3. I have heavy facial hair and it cuts it real easy.4. Pros of this product i did not have to leave my house to buy it. 5. Best money i spend on a nice clipper. 6. The charger unit is extremely long so once you charge the unit you can actually use it plugged into the wall if desired.
10/14/2017	Amazon	4	"Used all attachments,  I'm happy enough."	"I have used all attachments and am happy with the purchase.  With the adjustable guard I can keep the few day beard-growth look I am trying to maintain. The detail trimmer works great on the fine hairs on my ears and the annoying nose hairs.  I especially like the body hair trimmer attachment.  It makes trimming my fine (but long) back hairs slightly easier with the straight up and down design---much easier than a razor.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 star review was because the stupid electric razor attachment is junk, that's probably to be expected though.  I am not too concerned with the batter life because when the lithium ion battery dies I will just go to my local battery shop to have it replaced or buy a new one (it was cheap after all),"
10/14/2017	Amazon	1	You get what you pay for	Don't expect this to work and you will be happy.  The nose trimmer is a joke.  I should have known though.
10/15/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	works as designed
10/15/2017	Amazon	3	It was awesome while it worked	"It was awesome while it worked, however, due to my outlet breaker being flipped, I believe that caused some wires to cross, and now the product only charges but wont turn on. I don't know if there is any warranty on this thing, or I'd be sending it back for a new one."
10/15/2017	Amazon	5	Such a great trimmer for the $	"Such a great trimmer for the $!  I paid 3x as much for a Phillips model less than a year ago and compared to this trimmer, hands down this one wins.  The trim height guide is best part, it sets up and stays put.  More importantly, it doesn't really flex so you get consistent trimming on a beard."
10/15/2017	Amazon	1	Works but a couple of problems	UPDATE 1/2/2018  It stopped working. I use it only to trim a beard and I do that at most two times a week. Its a shame as I liked it even though it had some bugs.  This unit performs just as well if not better than the trimmer I have been using for years. That trimmer costs three time as much. I saw this Remington offered at a sight called 9-5 Toys and it looked pretty good. The price was under $13.00. I needed a second trimmer for use at the rehab hospital when going in for physical therapy and didn't want to spend a fortune. I've used it a couple of times now at home and it seems to do very well. My use will be for the beard trimming only but the other attachments look pretty sturdy. The reason I gave the trimmer only four stars is two fold. The trimmer is not easy to understand. Looks simple enough but the beard combs really caused a bit of confusion. It took a bit of time to figure out and the lack of instructions didn't help. I finially figured it out. The other problem I found is my unit didn't come close to lasting 50 minutes of use. After a complete charge the battery died after two light beard trims in less than 30 minutes. This might be just my unit but you better check. Everything else is fine. Fits easily in the hand and when finished all the parts fit in the little travel bag. For the price I paid I really can't complain.
10/16/2017	Amazon	1	Won't charge after short period of time.	"I've had the same problem as other users. Bought in April and loved it. In August, I put it on the charger and it won't charge. Out of nowhere. Very disappointed."
10/16/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	love this item
10/17/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works well and holds a charge. Husband uses it daily and has had no issues
10/17/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Stopped charging in month.
10/17/2017	Amazon	5	Trimmer	I use it for trimming sideburns and stuff.  It works much better than the little battery operated ones.
10/17/2017	Amazon	5	Portable and good enough accessories	I use this to trim my dog's hair.  Works well.  Portable and good enough accessories
10/18/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Ridiculously good for the price you pay.

10/18/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Nice, long lasting battery and good enough attachment selection"
10/19/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Performed as expected.
10/19/2017	Amazon	5	A true gem!	"love this thing. Wish I had gotten this sooner. Battery life is really good. I have for several weeks now and haven't had to recharge. I buzz my head no guard every 3 or 4 days, so I put this thing to work. The nose/ear hair extension does really well too. I trim my goatee with this too, makes it look real good... I highly recommend this."
10/19/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Excellent price for what you get.
10/19/2017	Amazon	4	"Look ma, no cords!"	"I've been using a cheap corded trimmer for a couple years, until I broke it trying to clean it, so it was time to upgrade a little. While the blades aren't as sharp as on my Oster (not a beard trimmer, and expected), it is cordless, uses a li-ion cell (more reliable than nihm cells), and it trims without catching or pulling (thus far; I've used it once). It also didn't cost me a kidney, so overall, I'm pleased."
10/19/2017	Amazon	4	Great for the price but not impressive	You get what you pay for. Great for the price but not impressive
10/20/2017	Amazon	5	Sweet!	awesome i love it!!!

10/21/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Very good I use this to groom dogs but Im sure all hair is the same lol
10/21/2017	Amazon	5	Great	Works perfectly fine! Battery lasts longer then expected! Great Product
10/21/2017	Amazon	1	Awful quality. Wast of money!	Only worked the first charge. Don't buy it!
10/22/2017	Amazon	1	Do not buy!	Highly disappointed in the battery on this trimmer. Ive had this trimmer for 2 months and it was getting the job done but it mysteriously stopped taking a charge. I recommend you DO NOT BUY!
10/22/2017	Amazon	5	Great trimmer!	One charge lasts a long time. Its easy to clean and is great for maintaining a beard and can also be used for clean shave.
10/23/2017	Amazon	5	99 and happy with the results	"Purchased mine this evening at CVS for the same $19.99 and happy with the results. I look much better with stubble than with a full on beard, because Im light haired and with the onset of grey, my full beard looks less than full. Stubble however looks darker and more even, and I e been meaning to buy a trimmer forever so I dont have to go to the barber every time I want a trim. The Remington was excellent. Easy to use - just slip on the #1 attachment (3 mm) and start shaving. It took about ten minutes to get the results I aimed for but Im thrilled with the results. In ten minutes I went from a two-week bushy beard and stash to looking like its only Day 3, which is exactly what I wanted."
10/23/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	loved it
10/23/2017	Amazon	5	Good buy	Good size. Trims close and works well so far. Battery last long. Not stand just comes with a travel thin bag.
10/23/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Good razor for the money.  Replaced the same one bought 5 years ago. Trims my husband's beard just fine.

10/23/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	It's Just what I wanted good product
10/23/2017	Amazon	1	Try Something Else	"It worked well for the first month. After that, it won't turn on unless I plug it in and then remove the cord."
10/23/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Good Product
10/23/2017	Amazon	5	this replaced the same model I purchased five years ago which worked great. Priced right	"Handles well, this replaced the same model I purchased five years ago which worked great. Priced right."
10/23/2017	Amazon	1	Worst experience every	It worked very well for the first two months and then it was unable to charge. It maybe that the battery couldn't hold charge our the charger had problems but all I know is the trimmer does not work anymore.
10/24/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	WORKS AMAZINGLY
10/24/2017	Amazon	3	pretty good	gets the job done
10/24/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Stopped recharging after two months.

10/25/2017	Amazon	5	It works well	Except for the stand which is very flimsy everything else is of good quality and it works well.
10/25/2017	Amazon	3	Best temporary shaver	"This shaver is great for at least 6-8 weeks, after that the batter dies. Ive purchased at least 3 because they are so cheap. If youre looking for quality, I wouldnt purchase this one. If youre looking for something to get you by until you find one you really like this one works just fine... but dont drag your feet, it wont last too long."
10/25/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great.
10/25/2017	Amazon	1	Died Quick	Dead in two months.  Just after the return window.
10/25/2017	Amazon	4	A good beard trimmer.	It has a powerful motor and the attachments are mostly good too. But the electric razor attachment is too small for general shaving purposes and isn't as close a shave as it could be.
10/25/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Worked for a month and now it doesnt hold a charge.
10/25/2017	Amazon	5	Genuinely lithium	"There was some question as to what battery the PG6025 has in it . I took mine apart to verify (do not try this at home) . What I found inside was indeed a 3.2 volt Li-ion battery 600mAh . I've owned mine for 6 months now and it still works like new . For the price , highly recommended ."
10/26/2017	Amazon	5	I highly recommend this product	This beard trimmer said is working wonderfully
10/26/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works like a champ easy to clean
10/26/2017	Amazon	4	Good for price but don't pay more than $20	"comes charged and ready to use. Cuts decently, but not extremely high quality. Good for price but don't pay more than $20."
10/26/2017	Amazon	3	For price its goos	"It works, not as powerful as it bought but for the price it works. If your looking for a cheap trimmer this one is good"
10/27/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	works good
10/27/2017	Amazon	3	Decent for the money.	Basic trimmer that does what it's supposed to. Good for removing long hairs before a shave but don't expect a close shave from the trimmer alone.
10/27/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Will use them again
10/27/2017	Amazon	3	It just doesn't perform well with the attachments on. ...	"It just doesn't perform well with the attachments on.  It pulls and doesn't cut well. I would've returned them, but to late."
10/27/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great trimmer. Holds charge well
10/28/2017	Amazon	5	Best clippers ever	"Best clippers I've EVER had in the 23 years I've been shaving my head. Works great, works fast and I haven't had to charge them yet!"
10/28/2017	Amazon	4	Great item to put in a travel case	I got this little guy today and it is very versatile!  Great item to put in a travel case!  I believe I used it consistently for 30 minutes or so(it comes with a charge) and there was no waning of the battery.  Very sharp blades and they are self sharpening!  The only things I didn't like was I had a couple of hair pulls when using the foil shaver but I did get a nice close shave and I thought the hair trimming attachment that comes with and you can set at 8 different locations was a little flimsy. I do want to mention I had to break out the instructions to find how to remove and change the attachments.  You have to turn it 1/4 turn in one direction to put it on and 1/4 in the other direction to take it off.  Over all this is a very handy item for home or travel!
10/28/2017	Amazon	4	Great value	"Using this as a 1st personal groomer for my little one, quite a bit of options for the cost, the rechargeable option is a definite plus."
10/28/2017	Amazon	4	Great just not 100% waterproof.	Has a powerful motor that trims my beard without getting snagged (although that may differ for people for people with thicker beards). My favorite feature is that its rechargeable. It is not waterproof and cannot be used in the shower.
10/28/2017	Amazon	2	Two Stars	Product was good until it died. Had for about four months and now doesn't work.
10/29/2017	Amazon	5	Great for the price.	Works good but is what you pay for and it was cheap.
10/29/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	works for trimming not shaving. you might as well buy a real razor if you want a close shave
10/29/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great Product. On time delivery.
10/29/2017	Amazon	2	I liked it a lot	"worked for a few months, then nothing. Tried to recharge and still didn't work. When it did work, I liked it a lot."
10/30/2017	Amazon	3	is not as sharp as I would like	"It's ok, is not as sharp as I would like"
10/30/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	my boyfriend like it
10/31/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great product for the price!
10/31/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great
10/31/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	husband likes it
10/31/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	It cuts well.
10/31/2017	Amazon	5	Love this little thing	"Use it on my mustache for a close close shave look (my mustache is a little bit sensitive to razors). Works on my beard too but takes kind of long. I just use my Andis T-outliner for a close shave on my beard.  Side note, I tried those high end face shaver things with the 3 circles and they didn't work for me. My brother tells me that those shavers take about 3 weeks to get used to my skin? That just doesn't make sense to me lol This product works the very first day! and after 2 years + of use, and it looks worn, buy another one!"
10/31/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Good
11/1/2017	Amazon	1	Crap low quality	Went out
11/1/2017	Amazon	5	horrible shaver	"I can't fathom how Remington could possibly get any positive reviews from this inferior product.  I bot it long ago and decided to charge it and try it out.  Once charged, I tried to shave my 3 day growth and it shaved about one out of every 20 whiskers.  I don't think it could even shave frog's hair off.  what a piece of garbage and I will be writing to Remington about this.  to bad it doesn't weigh very much, I could use a decent boat anchor.  this deserves a -1"
11/1/2017	Amazon	5	Great product and very fast shipping	"Great product and very fast shipping. My husband loves it, he says it's the best he's had and we spend much less on this than his last trimmer. Would definitely buy from this seller again"
11/2/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	works great
11/2/2017	Amazon	5	Great product for the cost	Really happy with this trimmer. Had to replace the one I've had for the last 6 years. The blades are very sharp and cut great. The accessories all work as marketed and the bag is a nice touch for travel.
11/2/2017	Amazon	4	Nice buy	For the price a VERY nice shaver! Son uses it as back up when his went down. Worth the money!
11/2/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Delivered as described
11/2/2017	Amazon	5	Nice	Does the job! Nice clippers
11/2/2017	Amazon	1	Motor problems make this razor useless	"This product broke after 2-3 uses. I can leave it plugged into a wall outlet overnight, and when I turn it on the next day, the battery seems fine at first but eventually dies the second that the razor makes contract with my hair. I don't actually think that it's a battery problem; it appears the resistance of my (short, thin) facial hair is causing the motor to seize up. In it's current state, it's absolutely useless and a waste of my money."
11/3/2017	Amazon	4	Im the last one with this much sauce	Youre not living yet
11/3/2017	Amazon	2	Two Stars	"Not as shape as I expected, takes long time to shave."
11/3/2017	Amazon	5	Highly recommended	Awesome little shaver. Easy to use and the battery lasts a very long time between charges. All attachments work perfectly. The foil shaver saves me from using a razor with any regularity. A quick brush with the foil shaver and you're good to go. I only use a razor once a week now. Keep it clean and I'm sure it will last a very long time.
11/3/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Excellent
11/3/2017	Amazon	4	Good.	It is a good product. I recommend it.
11/3/2017	Amazon	5	Great product	High quality product. Professional qualitty. The best Ive ever had
11/3/2017	Amazon	1	Two Stars	It stopped charging after only charged once
11/3/2017	Amazon	2	I don't like how big	"I don't like how big, thick and cumbersome the guard is.  When I use it to cut my mustache, I can't see what I'm cutting because the head of the guard is so large."
11/4/2017	Amazon	5	Excellent Product	"Love It, Works Awesome"
11/4/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great for quick grooming.
11/4/2017	Amazon	3	I think there are better shaving products out in the world	"I guess you get what you pay for, as this was very inexpensive...and it - for my money - is a very mediocre product. It shaves, but not all that close. I wouldve returned it I hadnt used it multiple times over a month period.  Im just saying: buyer beware. I think there are better shaving products out in the world, but youll prob need to spend a little more money."
11/4/2017	Amazon	1	Feels cheap	"Yup, thats right."
11/4/2017	Amazon	5	I love it its nice to have for kids and its ...	I love it its nice to have for kids and its small and it don't make your Hand feel like its gonna be viberated off
11/4/2017	Amazon	4	"Nice trimmer, with many accessories"	Works great. Has many options for trimming with lots of accessories. Would buy again.
11/4/2017	Amazon	5	Very pleased with this purchase	Just as the description suggested! Very pleased with this purchase.
11/5/2017	Amazon	4	"Good if used right, guys pay attention."	"I've been using this trimmer for years, replacing it every year or so.  The main trimmer blade will get dull after about a year of use.  When I first used it on my face (to keep a 5 o'clock shadow look) it trimmed so well I almost looked clean shaven.  After a month or so it dulled a little and would leave it the perfect length.  After about a year of using it 5 times a week it becomes too dull to trim close enough for a good look.  DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT use the ADJUSTABLE trimmer guide attachment, especially in ""sensitive"" areas!  With very little pressure it will snap closed and the #3 you were aiming for will become a #1.  The spacing on the combs for the adjustable guide is very far apart. Resulting in some hairs cutting closer then others. The wide spacing also makes it easy for any ""loose"" skin to get caught in between and make contact with the blades.  I'm not a fan of the nose/ear trimmer attachment.  It is essentially a smaller version of the regular trimmer attachment.  The blade is too exposed for the nose and ear so if you're not careful it's easy to cut your skin.  I never use the beard foil attachment. I tried it a few times but it is so small that it will quickly fill up with hair particles and stop working correctly reducing the convenience of it.  With that said the regular trimmer attachment and 3 black swappable trimmer guides (not the clear adjustable one) work well.  The trimmer is light and small allowing easy control around the body and ""down there"".  Even though the stainless steel trimmer attachment will dull in about a year you can buy just the trimmer body with trimmer head for around $10. About what it would cost if you tried to just buy trimmer replacement by itself."
11/5/2017	Amazon	2	Good buy	"Really great product, have used it twice now since getting it. Only thing is that I though after leaving the product to charge for the 4 hours that I would have seen a full charge indication, but just seems to light up one of it's blue lights that's built in. The additional pieces are awesome as well, the shaving blade though, doesn't seem to get all the hairs - maybe because I have corase hair and the foil shaver is like another handbug, doesn't shave off a lot of the stubby hair after shaving. But not a bad buy at all. I may after all try the rugged look for a new change"
11/5/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Best razor I've seen yet it's a very good deal for under $20
11/5/2017	Amazon	3	Three Stars	It's ok. The nose and ear attachment does not work well.
11/5/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Good product
11/6/2017	Amazon	3	Shaver works as intended	Shaver is great but the case is horrible. We ended up putting everything in a basket.
11/6/2017	Amazon	5	Love the trim settings	"Love the trim settings, removes the need for all sorts of sizes of trim guards, instead giving you one adjustable one. The battery lasts quite a while, and charges in no time flat."
11/6/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Doesnt have a fine trimmer with it.
11/6/2017	Amazon	1	Stopped holding a charge after less than 2 months of ownership.	Stopped holding a charge after less than 2 months of ownership.  I strongly recommend you look elsewhere for a shaver.
11/7/2017	Amazon	2	Will work for 3 months	"Works great; then the battery dies and you'll have to shell out another $30 or whatever for a new one.  I had two, same results each time; finally switched to a corded model, which is clunky but bulletproof."
11/7/2017	Amazon	3	"Mesh head can't cut, but only hoard a lot ..."	"Mesh head can't cut, but only hoard a lot of hair in it. So used original head to cut all the places."
11/7/2017	Amazon	3	Not right for him	"More of a hair trimmer than beard trimmer?  Bought this for a teen who is new to shaving and has quite a thick, long but scraggly beard.  He wanted to trim it up, but he was unsure of which heads to use, not much instructions, tried unsuccessfully, experienced a lot of confusion, gave up and just shaved it all off.  This might be a really great trimmer, but it was a complete flop for us."
11/7/2017	Amazon	4	Good shaver	"Is a great product, but the foil shaver leaves alot to be desired but otherwise is an excellent product."
11/7/2017	Amazon	4	great price!	I should have got this a long time ago. great price!
11/8/2017	Amazon	1	Don't Bother	"Don't even bother. It's not returnable, likely because it doesn't actually work. I went over the same areas over and over again, but a razor and scissors would do a faster and better job. I thought maybe I was using it incorrectly, so I tried different attachments as they were intended, but still no luck. Hopefully somebody at Goodwill will have a use for it, because that's where it's going."
11/8/2017	Amazon	5	Great Product	Got this for my son and he loves it. You can do everything with all the attachments it comes with
11/8/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great! Love the different features it comes with. Excellent product for the price!
11/9/2017	Amazon	3	Not a Charging Stand	The stand is not a charging stand.  The charging cord does not plug into the stand for simple drop in charging.  There isn't a good solution for eye brows.  What it does come with seems to work very well.
11/9/2017	Amazon	1	Poor build quality. Broke very quickly	"Unfortunately this hasnt lasted 2 months. The lights on the shaver itself went out after a month, and it appears the shaver was on borrowed time since then!  It now no longer holds any charge and wont work even when plugged into the mains. Disappointed. Next time I will spend a little bit more and get a better brand."
11/9/2017	Amazon	4	Great bidget trimmer!	"Great little beard trimmer for the money. I wish the accessories like the nose/ear hair trimmer and the shaver worked better, but oh well, at least it does its primary job well."
11/10/2017	Amazon	1	Save Your $$$$$	"No sharp at all, barley cut."
11/10/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	he loves it
11/10/2017	Amazon	1	Unreliable	Battery Failed after 1 charge
11/10/2017	Amazon	3	Three Stars	Exactly what I thought it would be.
11/11/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Well made good deal compared to what you can get in stores for the same amount
11/11/2017	Amazon	3	Weak	Motor is weak- It 's hard to shave my hair.
11/11/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great kit.
11/12/2017	Amazon	3	Three Stars	the nose trimmer is really dull.
11/12/2017	Amazon	5	But all in all a great product	I have had this now for a couple years.  Now the nose trimmer attachment isnt working as its supposed to.  But all in all a great product
11/12/2017	Amazon	2	Two Stars	Low price low proudct
11/12/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Excellent for the money
11/13/2017	Amazon	1	Bad bad bad please avoid!	Not quality at all. Stopped working after under 5 uses and not sturdy feeling at all in hand. I do not recommend this item at all!!
11/13/2017	Amazon	5	Great product	Item as described
11/13/2017	Amazon	2	"for the price ok, but it does not cut ..."	"for the price ok,but it does not cut very sharp."
11/14/2017	Amazon	5	Good price point	The spot for the 3 clipper attachments could have been designed better. Device works just fine.  No cleaning brush included.
11/14/2017	Amazon	3	... i buy this product the machine is solid works great. BUT i need the	4th time i buy this product the machine is solid works great. BUT i need the: 8 length trimmable comb. its the main one i use and it always breaks out. first from the holding clip. then the upper combs break off one by one. but the everything else is good!
11/14/2017	Amazon	1	Battery died within 3 months	"Despite that I was using it only for trimming my beard once every alternate weekends, so all in all, I didn't use it a lot. Within 3 or so months, the battery is dead already.  Even though it is cheap (I bought it for about $20), it is not worth buying considering poor quality of the battery.  I have used Remington trimmers in past, but this was really the worst! Wouldn't recommend buying."
11/14/2017	Amazon	1	I have had it just about 60 days used it maybe 6 times and the battery has already gone bad and wont take a charge or power up	"Please do yourself a favor and do not buy this product. I have had it just about 60 days used it maybe 6 times and the battery has already gone bad and wont take a charge or power up. Also, i only charged it twice. Once, when i bought it and the second a few weeks ago. But, this has been a common problem with all other Remington products i have purchased.  Definitely not recommended"
11/14/2017	Amazon	1	the attachments break on it easy and it pulls hair	"Battery does not last, the attachments break on it easy and it pulls hair. Not recommended."
11/14/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Totally worth it
11/14/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Item is a gift. Appears to be just what the person wants
11/15/2017	Amazon	5	Good trimmer for the money.	Works great.
11/15/2017	Amazon	5	Great buy	Husband very happy with new trimmer.  He has used it frequently and is impressed that it hasn't needed to be charged.  Lots of trim options
11/15/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	great
11/15/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	I LIKE IT...WORKS GREAT.......
11/15/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Pretty nice trimmer i must say. It'll get the job done.
11/15/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Nice tool. This is my second one.
11/16/2017	Amazon	5	Good solid clipper	"Good solid clipper, with a good selection of attachments. Huge improvement on what we had before. Cradle is nice to have."
11/16/2017	Amazon	1	Do not buy	"Had this for less than 3 months, maybe used it 4 times and now it's completely dead and will not work."
11/17/2017	Amazon	5	Great buy.	Bought this for hubby he loves it!
11/17/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	it stopped working after less than a month
11/17/2017	Amazon	5	Great trimmer.  Great value!	Great trimmer...at an amazing price.  Plugged it in once when I got it and have used it for several weeks without a second charge.  Really handy attachments. Highly recommend.
11/18/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Pretty good economic kit
11/18/2017	Amazon	1	Under Powered	Not enough power to properly shave or trim
11/18/2017	Amazon	4	Four Stars	A
11/18/2017	Amazon	4	Good	"Works great, there are so many parts and the stand takes up space and requires work to keep up. I only use one attachment now and keep it all in my favorite coffee cup that lost its handle ( it fits in there is the point)"
11/19/2017	Amazon	5	This is the best trimmer I have ever used	This is the best trimmer I have ever used!!! Love all the different attachments and the charge lasts for a long time.
11/19/2017	Amazon	5	Good clippers good value.	This product was easy to set up. I had my beard trimmed quickly and it looked evenly cut across my entire beard.  I then used the ear/nose clipper attachment and cleaned up the hairs growing out of me ears.  Im glad I got this.
11/19/2017	Amazon	5	Works great.	Has everything you need for grooming.  Works great.
11/19/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	great electric razor
11/19/2017	Amazon	1	Like many others	"Like many others, the trimmer stopped holding a charge after only a few months of use.  Look for a better option for longevity."
11/19/2017	Amazon	1	"Cheaply built accessories, poor recharge life,"	Poor quality. Rechargeable battery begins its rapid decent into failure after the 3rd/4th charge. plastic pieces  are brittle and easily broken (beard trimmer particularly). Spend a few dollars on a better rated item more and save yourself the disappointment and frustration.
11/19/2017	Amazon	2	Two Stars	Little and doesn't work like I hope. I prefer Phillips Norelco 3000 for the same price
11/19/2017	Amazon	1	Doesnt work very well	"The detail trimmer does not work very well at all, neither does the guarded trimmer. Very dissapointing. Only good if you are going to use the trimmer with one of the three black guards or without a guard."
11/20/2017	Amazon	5	Excellent	This thing rocks. Takes a charge in no time and seems to last for quite bit of time and will hold that charge over time too.
11/20/2017	Amazon	3	Three Stars	Works great just wish it had a stand to hold everything.
11/20/2017	Amazon	5	"Love it, sharp blades, long lasting battery, and at an affordable price"	"The battery is amazing!!! I purchased over 2 months ago and i have yet to charge it, and its still running full power. Blades are super sharp and the heads are very easy to swap out. This is the best electric trimmer I have ever purchased and am now completely converted from my old Wahl clipper. Hands down there is no better beard/body hair trimmer on the market for this price, highly recommend."
11/20/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Can't believe life of charge
11/20/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great brand razor at a great price.
11/21/2017	Amazon	5	Do the job	"Good for the price would like to have more sizes, Pretty good for the skin"
11/21/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	I am happy with the extra attachment which gives you more options.
11/21/2017	Amazon	1	Not working	"I received this product in June 2017.  As it was not ready to be used, it was charged, it came on, and it was packaged awa in the original packaging.  Now after charging, it does not come on.  At all.  When plugged in, the bars on the front light up, but when unplugged and turned on, absolutely nothing happens.  Very disappointed."
11/22/2017	Amazon	5	Absolutely love it and would buy again!!	"Seriously stronger than every other trimmer I've ever had, even the wired ones. It never gets stuck or jammed and holds its charge for a very long time! Would for sure buy again"
11/22/2017	Amazon	1	Broken	It broke the other day less than 3 months old
11/22/2017	Amazon	1	Dud	Does not work.  I had the same one that i bought from retailer that was amazing.  this one seems to be a factory second or dud.  Didnt get a chance to use yet and now cant return. watch out
11/22/2017	Amazon	5	"Useful, Dependable, and Inexpensive!"	"For the price, it was a bargain.  It has stood up well to regular use.  The attachments are easy to use, once you figure out how to switch among them.  The paperwork included is not helpful, but ithe puzzle is easily solved."
11/22/2017	Amazon	5	Longest lasting grooming kit I've ever owned.	This device just lasts year's and year's almost ten had gone by until needing a replacement. Worth every penny.
11/22/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Price was Great.....It does what it said it would do. Very accurate.
11/23/2017	Amazon	5	I like it because it he no longer looks like a ...	Husband likes it. I like it because it he no longer looks like a Bushman. Fast delivery.
11/23/2017	Amazon	3	Pretty good beard trimmer	Trimmer works good. Doesnt pull hair. Just using the trimmer without any attachments cuts close to face without pulling hair. Shapes beard good with attachments
11/23/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	"Have two, both broken in few weeks."
11/23/2017	Amazon	1	Shaver stops working after only a few shaves.	"When this shaver works, it cuts very well. Even with coarse beard hair. But this was my second one within a year. The first one dies within 6 months and I thought maybe it was just defected and bought another one. But now the second one has died within 4 months. I only used the shaver 2-3 times a month. Very poor quality if it only lasts for 18 shaves."
11/24/2017	Amazon	1	Stopped working after 2 uses	Terrible product. The razor stopped taking a charge after 2 uses. Customer service was useless. Spend your money elsewhere.
11/24/2017	Amazon	1	I knew the price was too low for good	Threw it away. Cheap razor. I knew the price was too low for good razor
11/24/2017	Amazon	4	flavor saver quandry	"so this is a good grooming kit...I struggled on 4 or 5 stars but had to settle on 4...my one issue is I have a goatee and the trimmer is too wide for the ""center"" flavor saver area and if you switch to the ""small"" trimmer head it takes too long to clean it up...if you don't have that ""issue"" then its a 5-star product."
11/24/2017	Amazon	3	Theyre okay for a baby with a beard!	I have to practically scrape my skin to get these trimmers to work.
11/25/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	I LOVE IT!!!!
11/25/2017	Amazon	5	Go for it if you want Long Battery Life	"Great product at great price. This trimmer offer so much convience. Attachments are useful. Battery Backup is great compared to other brands. Previously I used Philips and Braun trimmers but, this one is way better in Battery Backup."
11/26/2017	Amazon	1	Horrible and Disgusting!	Horrible trimmer. Doesnt even turn on and is missing pieces from the entire set. It has clearly been used before. Someone elses hair was all over the trimmer. Disgustingly false advertisement.
11/26/2017	Amazon	5	it is really good! Buy it	"For this price, it is really good! Buy it."
11/27/2017	Amazon	2	Everything is good except the plastic heads that go on the razor	Everything is good except the plastic heads that go on the razor. They break easy. Normal use broke after just a couple months. Should sell them separately.
11/28/2017	Amazon	5	"Works great, lost charger"	"Have been using one of these for several years. Works great, lost charger, difference in price between full kit and charger insignificant bought the whole thing instead."
11/28/2017	Amazon	5	Great Value!	"This is not a heavy duty razor, so if you're looking for an all metal unit look elsewhere. It feels very light in your hand. With that said, this thing is great! I charged it for about 15 min out of the box and have shaved around my beard several times with no loss of power. I love the shape of the head when shaving with the clipper - different than the traditional style but this is more effective for shaping a beard line. I haven't used all the attachmens but the razor, and clipper work great! Overall, this thing is awesome. As long as it lasts a year or so it will be more than worth the value. Honestly I can't belive ppl spend 75+ dollars on these things when there is just no reason to."
11/28/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	great product it works great and is a great price
11/28/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Got compliments on the beard being trimmed so they got the job done!

12/2/2017	Amazon	1	Not to cut hair	The attachment that you are supposed to use to cut hair doesnt stay in place . I ended up cutting a good chunk of hair and ruined my sons hair !
12/2/2017	Amazon	3	... is the one I use the most because I like a close shave but after a while	"The foil blade is the one I use the most because I like a close shave but after a while, the foil (which is very flimsy) started to peel off and expose parts of the razor. Now when I use it, the razor will sometimes catch my skin and give me a small cut"
12/3/2017	Amazon	5	Great trimmers for a great price	I bought these for my dad because my boys broke his that he loved so much. I thought I would never be able to replace his. He loves them. He said they have just right attachments you will need to groom your face. They are strong and hold a great charge.
12/3/2017	Amazon	4	Great travel trimmer	"This small trimmer is great for travel and works as described. I haven't tested the shaving piece but everything works nicely. The only downside is that after 10 minutes of use, the metal piece gets very warm/hot. I know it's just friction but thought it would be a little longer before that happens.  Still very happy with the purchase"
12/4/2017	Amazon	5	Awesome	Ive had this product for a few months and I still havent charged it! Awesome
12/4/2017	Amazon	5	Well groomed at a great price-point	Great kit with a nice selection of guards and accessories.  Holds a charge nicely (thanks to Li batteries).  Great price for a great product.

12/6/2017	Amazon	5	What a great deal. Cannot go wrong with this	What a great deal.  Cannot go wrong with this.  Dont spend 100 on something that you can get for under 20
12/6/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Can't go wrong. Charge lasts forever!
12/7/2017	Amazon	5	Does everything you need.	"This will do any kind of ""hair management"" that you may want or need to do. Rechargeable battery lasts about an hour each charge and comes with all the accessories shown. It's easy to clean as well. It was a good purchase."
12/7/2017	Amazon	1	Bad battery	After 1 week of use the battery started to die within minutes
12/7/2017	Amazon	5	Clean cutting machine!	I always get compliments on whoever borrows this. Love Remington and you should too.
12/8/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	Cheap batteries that died before even a full year's use and you can't replace.
12/8/2017	Amazon	3	3 stars	I really like the product and the price is great but the battery stopped charging and I only used it about twice a week.
12/8/2017	Amazon	1	One Star	"Stopped working just after the return window closed. Wont turn on at all, even when plugged in."

12/9/2017	Amazon	5	Worth the money	"Great product for whatever you need trimming. Long lasting battery, Powerful, convenient."
12/10/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	works great!

There's several youtube videos about replacing it, which I may or may not do. It's a shame it didn't last longer because when it did work, it worked wonders. Shaved my head and beard weekly with it."
12/10/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Good for beards but the attachments aren't suitable for cutting longer hair.

12/11/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great
12/12/2017	Amazon	4	Great Product!	This is definitely nice to have for both my fiance and I because he uses it to keep himself pretty clean shaven for work and I use it to keep my sides shaved down to the perfect length.
12/12/2017	Amazon	4	Works	Works as it should
12/12/2017	Amazon	5	Great product	Works phenomenally!
12/13/2017	Amazon	5	Very quiet and well made!	Very well made shaver!  MUCH quieter than my old Wahl shaver.  Just enough attachments to do just about any grooming imaginable but I use for my beard only.
12/13/2017	Amazon	2	Failed within weeks	"Pro - It is small, has many attachments that work well, and the blade itself has fine teeth that cut hair well.  Con - The battery failed after two uses, and it's all in recycling now  This seemed like such a great trimmer, but the battery completely died after 2 uses. I charged it fully before use, I did not leave it plugged in for days, I did not run the battery down to empty, it just stopped working. I did not attempt to return it, or contact anyone about it, I just recycled the entire thing and wrote it off as a bad purchase. I ended up buying another popular brand of trimmer from a brick and mortar store in town."
12/13/2017	Amazon	5	Has everything for hair styles	Great product
12/13/2017	Amazon	3	Three Stars	Good all around trimmer but it gets too hot!
12/13/2017	Amazon	1	Problems recharging	"I bought two of these electric razors. The internal battery went out on both of them within 6-8 weeks and I was unable to recharge it. I thought the first one might just be a defective model, so I bought another and had the exact same problem. Spend a little bit more and get a razor that will last you more than one charge."
12/13/2017	Amazon	1	A razor for 6 months	"My experience with this razor was quite awful. I used it about once a week to trim my beard. It did a nice job while it lasted, but after only 6 months it stopped working. The lights would go on, but the razor wouldn't turn on.  I reached out to the company to see what they could do for me, but they did not respond. I took it to a battery store and they told me that the battery was dangerous to replace. Basically, I waisted my money with this razor... also, the nose trimmer doesn't do anything."
12/14/2017	Amazon	1	It breaks after 2 weeks and doesn't give you a good shave.	Don't buy a grooming kit for 20 bucks. Why? It breaks after 2 weeks and doesn't give you a good shave.
12/15/2017	Amazon	5	"Female user here: Great for legs, etc"	"I purchased this to trim up (legs and otherwise) before I use an actual razor. This cuts the hair down to a managable length. Using this first saves time, and money. This also works better than female versions of the same."
12/16/2017	Amazon	5	WORKS REALLY GREAT!	"My Boyfriend ordered this, saved a ton of money versus buying in the store, and it works great."
12/16/2017	Amazon	1	Look somewhere else	"It worked great the first month. After that it didnt matter how much I let it charge or what head did I use , it stops working after 5 seconds. Really not worth it and sadly disappointed."
12/16/2017	Amazon	1	Highly do not recommend	"Bought the same product at another store, and after an hours use, the motor died to about half of its original power. Highly do not recommend"
12/17/2017	Amazon	5	"Excellent quality, lasts a long time without breaking down"	"Very handy trimmer.  Excellent quality, lasts a long time without breaking down."
12/17/2017	Amazon	4	Great for the Price	I use to have a 230 dollar Braun and It wore out on me. I purchased a unit similar to the Remington a couple of years ago And it work OK but I had to replace batteries all the time. I purchased this Remington and What I really love about it is the fact that I can use it for weeks without recharging it. I'm retired and I don't need a perfect shave and this works great for the price.
12/17/2017	Amazon	5	helps keep you lookin sharp	works great
12/17/2017	Amazon	1	Terrible!	I received a set that was used and had hair on it.  Terrible!
12/18/2017	Amazon	4	Great product for detailing and shape-ups only	"Best used when detailing and shaping up the face/beard, this is not for clean shaves fully but can be combined with foil shaver attachment to give the cleanest electric shave possible. I used it right out of the box, no charging to test it out and all attachments. All worked good and have been using it about 2 times per week. The nose hair trimmer attachment: must be aimed at certain angles in order to work fully, does not do a good job with eyebrows, your better off using a small scissors to get more of a clean cut. Foil shaver attachment: is great for detailing and looking extra clean in all areas, but it is not extremely powerful, you'll find yourself going through about 2 or 3 passes just for it to work on hairs even when trimmed down. Beard guard: Works well, but only goes in length of 2mm. So 2mm, 4mm, 6mm, etc. Sucks for people who trim there beard or other areas to 3mm length and such, you'll never get that cut. The 3mm, 6mm, and 9mm attachments: I only tested the 3mm guard on the blade, works well for beards and gives the great just shaved/trimmed look and feel, simple to attach to the razor, just push down and hear the click, only works well for beards and necklines, everything else not that great. The razor blade itself (no attachments): The full size trimmer trims to about 1-2mm with no attachments/guards added, but the blade itself gets very hot very fast. Overall, if you find this for a great deal with all attachments for $10 like I did, totally worth it. The pouch it comes with is great and keeps all attachments in it perfectly. Each attachment is held in a small plastic to cover it and all attachments are washable and reusable. Makes cleaning very easy."

12/21/2017	Amazon	1	the battery wont take or hold a charge sounds like it is about to die	"This product is junk, the battery wont take or hold a charge sounds like it is about to die. I got it about 2 months ago. My last trimmer lasted me 3 years and was only 50 dollars. The electric trimmer to replace a razor doesn't work at all still have to use a blade, the nose hair trimmer is not as good as the ones that are rounded. The beard trimmer worked pretty well for the first month, but the battery is shot now. Don't waste your money."

12/24/2017	Amazon	5	Best trimmer for the money on Amazon!	"Cant go wrong here. For the price, best trimmer out there. Battery is MUCH better then any other everyday trimmer I have ever bought and all the attachments you will need."
12/25/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	fiance loves it.
12/25/2017	Amazon	5	Can't rave about this product enough!	My husbamd recieved these as a present 2 years ago. We've been exceptionally hard on them because not only does he use them to trim his beard but I also use them to keep his head shaved every 2 weeks. After almost 2 years of hard wear and tear they started getting dull. Thankfully they still make them! We've tried using other brands. Even expensive ones bought from a beauty shop. None measure up to these! I hope they never stop making them!
12/25/2017	Amazon	5	Good quality for the price	"Good quality for the price. Easy to use, store, and recharge. It is light and feels a little cheap but im not a professional barber. Just need something easy to trim my beard, nose, ears hairs and for that it works great."

For the price this thing is right there in best bang for your buck category. I recommend this one for anyone who doesnt want to spend too much money but needs a nice beard trim.

Half the price, half the craftsmanship, the break or stop working within a couple of months in my case."
12/28/2017	Amazon	2	Blade not sharp enough for a Line-up!!	This trimmer is not sharp enough to line up facial hair. I purchased it primarily to be able to line up my mustache and hairline. It isn't sharp enough to do either one which makes it useless to me. It was a waste of money!
12/29/2017	Amazon	4	Definitely powerful enough to get the job done.	This trimmer has a powerful motor for its size. I have owned several other trimmers that ran on AA batteries and the motor just didn't seem powerful enough. This trimmer has a rechargeable battery and it really gets the job done! I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking of a cheap priced trimmer that just gets the job done!

12/30/2017	Amazon	3	"Nice trimmer, bad power supply"	"I liked this trimmer a lot at first because it didn't pull my beard hair out of my face and so far has stayed sharp, but after a couple months of using it the battery stopped charging. I took it apart to see if the battery or battery management chip had gone wrong but everything looked ok and was surprising well designed and made given the price point. I figured out the problem wasn't the trimmer itself but was the power supply that came with it was dead.  I replaced the power supply with different one after swapping the connectors and its back to working again. For those of you that might come across this problem the trimmer takes a 5VDC input with at least 320mA of current. A lot of 5V USB chargers fall under this spec. DC connector is positive center."

12/30/2017	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Bought for 3 of my sons - all love it for beards and haircuts
12/30/2017	Amazon	3	This is a good grooming tool for the price	"This is a good grooming tool for the price.  Helps keep my facial hair very neat and clean.  Only complaint I have is that the mini foil shaver attachment will wear and cause the foil to split open which exposes the blades and at that point the attachment is useless.  Already went through two of them and now have to order a third, which is $3.99.  So basically I have spent $12.00 on one attachment throughout its life when the whole trimmer and attachments currently go for $15.97."
12/31/2017	Amazon	1	Chipped teeth. Buy from store so you can check before purchasing!	"Bought for a Christmas gift.. Unfortunately, we didn't notice and on the main attachment a tiny piece was chipped off. It seemed fine at first until I noticed cuts on the back of my husband's neck. After looking closer, we could see the chip in one of the teeth. Very disappointed as I loved our old set."
12/31/2017	Amazon	4	ION way better then Ni-cad	"I used this to replaced the Ni-cad version of this trimmer. So far loving it actually working correctly. The ni-cad one got to the point it wouldn't work if it wasn't plugged in, way too soon in it's life time. And even then it was 50% speed (I think it's better then 5 years old). Probably why they upgraded the same trimmer to ION batteries. This one should last a good while. Oh and I tried the foil trimmer thing? I dunno never not used a razor for the clean parts before, I wasn't too impressed but I imagine they are all like that."

1/7/2018	Amazon	4	Very Good Beard Trimmer Especially for the Money	"I stopped shaving my face at the end of October (2017). After 10 weeks of doing very little in the way of trimming my beard I asked my son what he uses to trim his beard. He recommended this Remington PG6025. I finally used it yesterday. I have to say that for the price I doubt I could find a trimmer that does a better job. The bare trimmer blade cuts very precisely without the attachments, however if using it without attachments use caution. It's easy to trim closer than intended. The head attachments will keep from cutting too much but may require repeatedly going over the same areas. I like its size and the fact that it has a rechargeable lithium battery which holds its charge a long time. I like the two year warranty, although it's necessary to keep the warranty information and the purchase receipt in a place you can easily find it if you need it.  There are a couple of things about the product that could use improvement. The charging indicator light stays on when the charging cord is connected, and there doesn't seem to be any indication when the battery is fully charged. Although there are three ""windows"" through which the charging indicator can be seen, the brightest indicator is always the one is in the center. I've charged mine twice, one of which was for a few hours  without any sign the battery was fully charged. Secondly, the instructions are bare bones. If you are looking for information on which attachments are best for specific uses, these instructions will not assist you. There is far more information about the safety warnings, the warranty and the 60 day satisfaction guarantee than for the use of the product."

I had it 5 years till it died and to be honest could not have been happier with the battery life. I miss placed the charger because it ran for 6 months on a single charge. Im buying a second one because it has to be the best 20 dollars I ever spent.

1/12/2018	Amazon	1	Overheating problem	The head overheats in about 5 minutes of using. Not very convenient to shave after that. Sucks that the problem surfaces after it is eligible for a return/replace on amazon. Scummy tactics by the manufacturer by the looks of it
1/12/2018	Amazon	4	Pros: Ergonomic and lightweight. Recharges in 4 hours ...	Pros: Ergonomic and lightweight. Recharges in 4 hours as claimed. Lasts over an hour of run time.  Cons:  Gets VERY hot in a short amount of time to the point of being dangerous to the skin.
1/12/2018	Amazon	4	Do not leave any parts laying around that your cat might find!LOL	Could not beat the price!
1/12/2018	Amazon	2	poor battery and poor performance	you get what you pay for. it was a decent but now it doesn't hold a charge. doesn't give a close shave has i hoped. I tried to replace my barber shop this is but it didn't. poor battery and poor performance. good thing is its amazing size. fits my hands great
1/12/2018	Amazon	3	Doesn't do a very good job shaving.	Not the best shaver on the market by far. Takes a long time to get all wiskers.
1/12/2018	Amazon	2	Good until it needs to be charged.  Practically disposable	Worked for the 65 hours promised but then went to charge and it doesn't work any more.  Charged overnight twice and gets a 7 sec usage out of it.  Normal use was for about 3-5 min every other week so it lasted awhile but now is a piece of junk.  Would have expected better.
1/13/2018	Amazon	1	Does not work that good	"this razor is not good. I bought for my husband, he used it once and packed it back up. Said that clipper left uneven hair and pulled. Also the attachment for smoothing didnt do anything. He went back to his old razor.  Disappointing"
1/13/2018	Amazon	5	Great product	I got this for my husband for Christmas.  He has a small go-tee.  He loves it.  He says it is perfect for shaving and shaping.
1/13/2018	Amazon	1	"don't buy, very cheap and won't work"	"worked only twice then died, but do you really think you can get a working trimmer for $15 including shipping? Do yourself a favor and put a little bit money into it and get one that will work. I was about to leave the house to meet up some friends and it didn't work. waited another hour while it was charging and tried to use it again and it didn't work. Only reason I bought it was the reviews and ""Amazon choice"" I honestly think the seller wrote all of those cause it just does't work. very cheap useless product. I don't use it much and it's still fairly new but after 2 months of course you can't return it."
1/13/2018	Amazon	3	Three Stars	Not as great as my plug-in razor but ok for the price I guess
1/13/2018	Amazon	5	10/10 would buy and reccomend	"I have recieved it in one piece . It work better then I have expected. For it's price, it is well worth it. I couldn't have wishes for better"
1/13/2018	Amazon	1	I have had the unit for less than 1yr and ...	"I have had the unit for less than 1yr and it no longer works. Gives me a green light that it is charging, but will not turn on. Was only used once per month over the past 9 months."
1/14/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Battery wears out quickly
1/14/2018	Amazon	3	Toy Set	Not what I expected. It is so tiny that it looks more like a toy for dolls. It is only good for rough shaving and trimming. Fine tuning needs still to be done with wet shaving.
1/14/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Excellent Product for the Money. Best trimmer I've owned so far. The attachments are great and like that it has adjustable attachment to Trim Goatee and Mustache for percise trim. Highly recommended if your looking for a Trimmer
1/14/2018	Amazon	5	easy to charge	"Small, light, easy to charge.  Works great to trim my facial hair."
1/15/2018	Amazon	4	Hard to list cons since the price is so good; however	"Hard to list cons since the price is so good; however, if I was to complain it would be that the blade doesn't cut to a smooth shave."
1/15/2018	Amazon	5	I would recommend this product to anyone at three times the price	Where is this product been all my life? I wore a beard in the winter for years and had trouble trimming it with a clunky beard trimmer.  I would recommend this product to anyone at three times the price. 20 bucks? Its a steal. The battery seems to be the most impressive part right now as I could literally leave it running for two days before it runs out. Plenty of attachments to play with. I like the mini electric razor attachment to get those places where the trimmer cant really reach good.
1/15/2018	Amazon	5	Works Great For the Price.	"I am a black male with a full beard and these clippers work great for the price. They aren't as sharp or powerful as the Andis pair that I keep at home, but for shaving on the go I am glad I have these clippers. I charged them for 6 hours out the box and have shaved at least 3 times and haven't noticed a reduction of power yet."
1/15/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"excellent very satisfied with my Remington PG6025, lightweight, smooth and perfect cut."
1/15/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	"Absolute 100% shite. Broke after five months. Avoid, son."
1/15/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Nice
1/15/2018	Amazon	5	Great grooming kit for a beard.	Compact and does the trick.
1/16/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works well!
1/16/2018	Amazon	1	Stopped working in a few days	It got wet within a few days and stopped working. Wouldnt buy again. Still have the broken one in my bathroom reminding me to get a new one every day
1/16/2018	Amazon	5	but this kit was about $20 and boy do I hate shaving and taking care of my trimmers and such	"Alright, so not only did I get this a whole day early, but this kit was about $20 and boy do I hate shaving and taking care of my trimmers and such. This thing easily comes apart for easy cleaning, just 2 screws on the main trimmer and that's it, everything else either doesn't need it or comes apart with a press of a button. Does it's job fantastically. I've bought $60 trimmers that clogged up and would pull my hair after a day of use."
1/17/2018	Amazon	1	severely disappointed and would recommend buying something different	"Worked well for the first few weeks, then the battery stopped holding a charge. Now it won't run at all, severely disappointed and would recommend buying something different."
1/17/2018	Amazon	2	Not all attachment worked as described	"The standard attachment works just fine, but I bought it specifically for the foil attachment and it didn't work at all:("
1/17/2018	Amazon	4	Good for facial hair. Too small for hair.	"For beards and other facial hair maintenance, this works well. But this really shouldn't be billed as a hair clipper as well. While technically, you can use it for your hair, and it has the attachments to do so, it would take forever with the very narrow blade head. As long as you know what you are buying, it is a good value for the price. I just wish they had been less misleading in the description."
1/17/2018	Amazon	5	Wonderful grooming tool	This item is a wonderful grooming tool and is great for the bushey areas.
1/17/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Good trimmer
1/17/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	gift
1/18/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	MY BOYFRIEND LOVE IT
1/19/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	This is a terrible product it doesn't cut anything.
1/19/2018	Amazon	3	Low battery life	"Works well enough for the price, but the battery life is incredibly low. After using it for a year, I can only shave half my face before I need to charge it."
1/19/2018	Amazon	5	This is my 2nd one. The only reason I ...	This is my 2nd one. The only reason I bought a new one was because I dropped one of the guards and it broke.
1/19/2018	Amazon	5	Functions really well and saves time	Bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it! Uses all the attachments and really helps speed up his morning.
1/19/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Perfect for my daily grooming needs!
1/19/2018	Amazon	4	BUSHY FACED? WANT TO BE WELL-GROOMED? BUY THIS ONE .	"I bought this for my bald-headed son. What he lacks on his head he ,more than makes up for on his chin and face. He loves this set of grooming aids and the long time between charges too. Lots of useful attachments. Powerful Lithium battery.  If you too are bushy faced and prefer to be well-groomed, buy it."
1/20/2018	Amazon	1	Battery does not charge	It would not hold a charge right out of the package. After charging for several hours it died within one minute while shaving. Tried over several days to charge it and then just threw it away.
1/20/2018	Amazon	2	Two Stars	After 3 months it stopped working!!!
1/20/2018	Amazon	4	Low end trimmer but capable enough!	"Nice little trimmer.  I use a Peanut trimmer and in my opinion the Peanut is a lot better.  The Peanut has a wider blade and is smaller, plus it just seems to cut better.  Even still, I bought this Remington trimmer because it was on sale and the Peanut has a really fat power cable.  That makes it harder to take on vacation. This one has a nice thin cable, plus it's chargeable so it's pretty much ideal to take on trips.  It also has a nose hair trimmer which I needed, and the Peanut can't do it.  This one feels kind of light, and everything feels a little cheap, like the power button.  But it charged up just fine and I tested it, and it cuts just fine.  Plus it comes with a little drawstring travel bag.  It doesn't seem like this would last over a year if it was used every day, but you get what you pay for and it's not the worst either!"
1/21/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great price
1/21/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"easily changeable head, cuts clean. nice storage bag to keep it all together."
1/21/2018	Amazon	2	Two Stars	The attachments are not very good quality. Ended up buying another after 6 months.
1/21/2018	Amazon	1	Terrible battery	"I bought mine in July, and the battery on mine is already dead so it is completely useless. Perhaps the price is this cheap for a reason."
1/21/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	it helps my son keep his beard looking good.
1/22/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	great product
1/22/2018	Amazon	2	Two Stars	battery seems to last but doesn't seem sharp enough.
1/22/2018	Amazon	3	Good for the price	"It's a cheap electric shaver that has some nice attachments. I was surprised by the foil attachment for shaving, it was pretty effective. I purchased this primarily for the trimmer and it gets the job done."
1/22/2018	Amazon	3	Three Stars	It is good
1/23/2018	Amazon	2	"Good operation of the equipment, lousy duration of battery."	"definitely this model disappointed me, even after having made ""revive"" the battery, it worked a few days and again it broke down."
1/23/2018	Amazon	4	"Good trimmer, weak battery"	"Cuts great, I really like this kit! I'm reluctant to rate it 5 stars because I'm noticing some weakness in battery life. I'm not sure how much mileage I will get out of the product."
1/23/2018	Amazon	1	"Serious Battery Flaw. BEWARE, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!"	"Read the reviews. Serious battery flaw. It will work fine for awhile. I bought mine in Sept.of 17 and now it won't charge. Lots of reviews about bad battery. If you return it under warranty it will cost you postage and you're still stuck with a worthless trimmer. I am sitting here with an untrimmed beard and waiting for another trimmer to arrive. Better believe its not a Remington brand. Come on Remington, you are better than this."
1/23/2018	Amazon	1	Product failure.	I purchased a P6025 beard trimmer. The product seemed to be well made. On my first use of the trimmer the setting slipped and ruined my beard. I had it set at 14 a high/ long setting for my first use to be safe. As soon as a little pressure was applied to the handle the setting slipped to a 2. I had a patch that looked like a 10 stubble. Since my beard was ruined I kept testing the unit to see what went wrong. The setting for hair length would not hold. I didn't want to wait for the beard to grow back so I shaved it off. Very disappointed in this product.
1/23/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"good quality, great battery life between charges"
1/24/2018	Amazon	3	Three Stars	I wouldn't buy it again
1/24/2018	Amazon	3	and it worked great for many years	"Giving this 3 stars only because I owned one already. and it worked great for many years. Until one unseasonably warm day it jumped off the sink and did a Greg Lugainis and smacked its head while diving....into the toilet. Ordered a new one, it was defective, Amazon did refund me, unfortunalty I needed it right away so I ran to the mall and wound up having to pay 15$ more to get it from a retail store, but still a good product, quiet and does not pull the hair as some other brands do"
1/24/2018	Amazon	5	IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS	It works. It is very versatile. It seems to be a very good price for what it can do.
1/24/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	awesome
1/24/2018	Amazon	4	Works very well.	I'm impressed by how well this has worked so far.  Clean cuts without pulling on the hair and I haven't had to recharge it since it arrived.  My only gripe is that the comb attachments are flimsy and will wear out fast depending on how much you put them on and off.
1/24/2018	Amazon	3	Nice product although after using it for a while I ...	Nice product although after using it for a while I don't have much use for the extra attachments. But it's nice to have though. The only thing I disliked was that the adjustable plastic guard broke. It's not that strong.
1/24/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	great product/ better price.
1/24/2018	Amazon	1	the trimmer feels like it's dying already	"The battery is very weak. On a full charge, the trimmer feels like it's dying already."
1/24/2018	Amazon	5	The best hair cutter for the price.  Excellent product.	"Probably the best hair cutter in the market for the price.  I have been using it for many years and keep buying the same thing over and over again.  For the price, it is the best in the class and it won't let you down."
1/25/2018	Amazon	3	Replaceable battery would get it 5 stars	"This is the 2nd that I have purchased of this exact model. Great little trimmer for normal use. I would give it 5 stars if you could replace the battery with a rechargeable AA battery.  These little trimmers are sealed so when the battery  stops taking a charge, you feel like you're throwing away a perfectly good trimmer.  The battery in the first one I purchased lasted about a year before it stopped taking a charge.  To be honest though I don't think it's worth spending more money. The ones for $10 to $15 more are about the same thing."
1/25/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great purchase
1/25/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Awesome product!!
1/25/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Wonderful product. Charging stays for months. Bought another one for my friend.
1/25/2018	Amazon	4	I like it a lot but it's very difficult for me ...	I like it a lot but it's very difficult for me to connect some of the attachment pieces which is frustrating. Other than that I love it as a whole.
1/25/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	NIce trimmer! Does the job well. Not using to shave a full beard or head hair though
1/25/2018	Amazon	5	Works great	"Works and cuts really great, I recommend this."
1/26/2018	Amazon	5	Gets the job done	"You can shave anywhere you can think of. Yes even down there. If you are going to SHAVE DOWN THERE, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND to use a guard for SAFETY. Youre welcome. And it works great. Nothing to complain."
1/26/2018	Amazon	2	battery does n't work	Dear i purchases this and few months now it doesn't charge or work at even when i keep the adapter plugged in power please i need replacement
1/26/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	EXCELENTE
1/26/2018	Amazon	5	Battery life is amazing	Amazing !!!!!!!!!! First time charging it since I bought it. I bought it (july 17th 2017) and I've never charged it until today (January 26 2018) I would use it once a week and honestly I never had a single problem with this product. Well worth the money!!!!
1/27/2018	Amazon	5	"Cuts close, clean and fast."	The attachments make it very versatile
1/27/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	doesnt turn on anymore after one week of casual use
1/28/2018	Amazon	2	Worked great but now it won't hold a charge	Had this for about 6 months . Worked great but now it won't hold a charge .
1/28/2018	Amazon	3	Not very good option. It is litter small and cut hair	We have to use batteries for this one..Not very good option. It is litter small and cut hair..
1/29/2018	Amazon	1	Faulty charger in the product	"Worked good till the first charge lasted(About 12-15 uses, 5 minutes per use which lasted me around 5 months without a single charge). Fantastic till then. But when I plugged the charger, it doesn't work. Now it's been more than 30 days and out of return period, and I can't return it. Not purchasing another product from Remington again."
1/29/2018	Amazon	2	Worked great.. now it doesn't hold a charge	Worked great..now it doesn't hold a charge.
1/29/2018	Amazon	5	Hair type	Nice product
1/29/2018	Amazon	1	Total junk	"Worked ok for the first month, after that the blade leaves chunks that it refuses to cut and battery barely last. Dont recommend at all!"
1/29/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	excellent
1/29/2018	Amazon	3	Three Stars	"Not so powerful, have issues with nose clipper, to no power"
1/30/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Good usage
1/30/2018	Amazon	5	All-in-One	"Birthday gift, he loves it!"
1/30/2018	Amazon	2	Battery Lasts About One Year	"After one year, the Lithium Powered Battery did not take a charge anymore. Which was sad. I used it weekly to trim my hair, mustache, and beard. Oh well. back to scissors and a WAHL barbering stix."
1/31/2018	Amazon	4	Is great except for the ear and nose hair trimmer attachment ...	Is great except for the ear and nose hair trimmer attachment which does not have enough grooves to do much trimming.
1/31/2018	Amazon	4	this does a great job. Holds charge a long time	"For the money, this does a great job.  Holds charge a long time.  Wish it was a little sharper."
1/31/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	works great
1/31/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	great economical razor
1/31/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great and so many features
1/31/2018	Amazon	4	Easy to Switch Attachments	"Works great, and attachments are easy to take on and off. Attachments don't allow for the smoothest or shortest of shaves, but that makes sense because it is a trimmer. The battery life seems to be good too."
1/31/2018	Amazon	5	excellent product.	cant beat the price. works great. great charge on it.
2/1/2018	Amazon	3	Three Stars	Product does not cut or edge as well as expected.
2/1/2018	Amazon	4	it works great! Holds a charge for a long time	"Don't expect a ""close shave"" with this product! Otherwise, it works great! Holds a charge for a long time."
2/1/2018	Amazon	5	"The main shaver unit is pretty good, and is powerful enough to cut through ..."	"The main shaver unit is pretty good, and is powerful enough to cut through my hair. If you are using the clip on combs, they work pretty well.  The bad news: The shaver does not allow a close shave. The adjustable length hair clicks into different length settings, but is too easy to nudge out of place when trimming your hair, so I don't trust it to trim evenly. Also if your hair is not very short, the attachment fills up quickly and you have to empty it often.  I just started using it, so will update if there are durability issues.  Update: Very impressed with customer service. The manufacturer contacted me and gave me a replacement (upgraded) unit. The variable length comb is much much better."
2/1/2018	Amazon	1	Short lived	"Sadly this worked great for only 3 months. It does not charge and was handled with perfect care. For context, every other beard trimmer I have ever had was same price range or cheaper and I had it for over 3 years till I used the blades up."
2/1/2018	Amazon	5	Excellent trimmer for the ladies!	"Ladies! This is a great personal trimmer for you know.. personal areas. It's a good size, cordless so you can take it anywhere, and it takes about 4 hours to charge it. I like it because I can use it without any of the attachments so it gets nice and close, leaves you looking clean and well groomed."
2/1/2018	Amazon	5	I've been looking for a shaver that gives that close ...	I've been looking for a shaver that gives that close shave without a razor and this product delivers just that.
2/3/2018	Amazon	5	buy an extra to leave in yur luggage so you will always have one when you travel	"very nice all in one, small enough to pack in your baggage with no issues.  Great razor, and nose hair trimmer.  Have not used the hair trimmer  yet"

The battery lasts a long time. All the accessories work great, easy to detach and watch different tips. I would recommend to all. The power is fast and strong. I've have for 6 months and still going strong"
2/4/2018	Amazon	5	Razor works great plugged in or on the battery	"I had read the other reviews that the battery wouldn't last which scared me before buying. I've had the razor since October and I have had nothing but a positive experience with the product. Razor works great plugged in or on the battery, all the attachments work as they should. Would highly recommend this product."
2/4/2018	Amazon	4	Good trimmer	Does a good job trimming.
2/4/2018	Amazon	5	Very happy with the product	"Very happy with the product, works very well and the battery life is much better than the one I was replacing. 5 stars"
2/4/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	The product works perfectly well however I thought I would get a stand for the shaver...Hmmmmm
2/4/2018	Amazon	5	works well	Husband loves how adjustable it is.  Says it was just what he needed for his beard. Arrived quickly.
2/5/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works as advertised.
2/5/2018	Amazon	1	This hair clipper is horrible. It's blade isn't sharp enough	"This hair clipper is horrible. It's blade isn't sharp enough, so if you use it, it either doesn't cut your hair, or you have to press down so hard that it ends up scratching and cutting your skin."
2/6/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	perfect
2/6/2018	Amazon	5	Works great for a terrific price	My old Ni-Cad powered Norelco trimmer finally expired (well the battery did) so I needed a replacement.  I really wanted something with a Li-Ion battery so that narrowed things down a bit.  This trimmer was a great price and so far it works great.  It's way more powerful than my Norelco trimmer ever was and I like that the trimmer itself has a metal base.  The flat nose/ear hair trimmer also works great and seems to work better than the circular style.  As long as the battery holds out I'll continue to be pleased.
2/7/2018	Amazon	4	One Star	given in error
2/7/2018	Amazon	5	Awesome product	I hate shaving and needed something to keep my stubble at bay so I can go to work without getting dirty looks lol. For the price I was super happy for this and I would definitely order it again. Also the battery lasts an insanely long time if you ask me I never worry about whether or not its charged
2/7/2018	Amazon	5	None Better for this Price	"I recently decided on a goatee. Good thing I got this kit because it has all the attachments I needed, to maintain a trim, sharp look. I love the pinpoint attachment that let's you zero in on a whisker or two at a time. The three combs are appropriately long (although I could have used a fourth option somewhere in the middle as mine was filling in). This arrived fully charged and ready to go. It doesn't get much easier than this! Please click below if this was helpful."
2/8/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	"Excelente, muy buena!!??"

2/9/2018	Amazon	4	it still works great for shaving and trimming hair	"So far, after owning it for a few months, it still works great for shaving and trimming hair."
2/9/2018	Amazon	5	Bought one 4 years ago. Still humming like new	"I bought one of these back in 2014 and it's still working like new. I came to amazon to buy another because the plastic clip I need the most (the adjustable one, after 4 years of heavy duty use) broke. Other than that, the machine it's still humming like freaking new! I am sticking to this brand/product."
2/9/2018	Amazon	5	This product works very well and is pretty quiet when using too	Had been looking for a decent trimmer for awhile and I knew my roommate had one very similar to this one but I didn't want to pay the price he did. This product works very well and is pretty quiet when using too. I love the holder.
2/9/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	exactly as described!

2/10/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	Battery dies in 3mins of usage
2/11/2018	Amazon	1	Unreliable	Battery ran out within 3 months and no way to replace.  Wouldn't recommend
2/11/2018	Amazon	5	Beastly!	"I was using a cheap shaver before I bought this and I'm so satisfied with the product. To be honest, this is my second purchase for this product. I got the first one and my brother used it once even before I did and he never returned it to me. He paid me the price and made this is number one shaver. Then I got a second one for myself and it works like butter. So many settings that you can get every hair on your body off with this. and it is so cheap. Recommended!"
2/11/2018	Amazon	5	Works great - good value	"Works great.  My husband bought this for beard trimming, never having had a beard to trim in his life until now.  He was skeptical because it was so inexpensive but hes very satisfied with it."
2/11/2018	Amazon	5	Awesome	This is a very nice trimmer for the price. Comes with everything youd need except maybe the oil. Battery lasts super long both when used and on standby. Nice and sharp after months of use and extremely easy to clean. Very happy with it.
2/12/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Good Quality.
2/12/2018	Amazon	3	I'll stick with Wahl.	"I mean, it works... For a few months. Battery lasts long time. The attachments are flimsy and the foil shaving attachment is good for about 10 uses before the blade is worthless. For the price it was fair and worth it for quick touch ups."
2/12/2018	Amazon	1	Wont take charge aft 10 months	Battery stopped taking a charge aft 10 months.
2/12/2018	Amazon	5	A cut above	Great product! Functions and gets the job done flawlessly. Love the attachments and choices you can easily make.Very satisfied!
2/13/2018	Amazon	5	Great!!	I am very satisfied with this. It arrived today so I figured would make use of it right away. Works excellent below the belt in groin region and on face as well.  I also was able to get rid of and shave off the pesky ear hair. This works great and a great value as well. The only downside is I wish I purchased it sooner. This a very nice product and does exactly what it's supposed and what I need it to.
2/13/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Nice product. Price very good too.
2/13/2018	Amazon	3	Three Stars	The only downside is that it feels really cheap
2/13/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	So far so good. Quiet and efficient.
2/13/2018	Amazon	5	Great trimmer	A great kit while it was made. I order some extra parts (the shaver part) for mine so I can keep using it longer than average.
2/13/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Husband seems to like it. The rechargeable feature is great!
2/14/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Stays charged for SOOOOO long
2/14/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Works good. I only use the nose hair trimmer and the clippers themselves to buzz my hair short short.
2/14/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works just as expected.
2/14/2018	Amazon	2	It'll do in a pinch	"I bought this after our luggage was lost and was waiting to get it back from the airport. My husband used it and it did work, but hasn't used it since we got the luggage back. He said it wasnt very powerful and tugged a little bit. So it's packed in the travel bag for the next trip because if this one gets lost he won't care"
2/14/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	"Trimmer sizes all good, but shaver bit hard"

2/15/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Christmas gift for my boyfriend he loved it
2/15/2018	Amazon	3	Meh	It is not the best I have used and the foil trimmer is a real joke. The attachments are not worth it and you will most likely just use the regular head.
2/15/2018	Amazon	5	Great value!	I use this just for goatee trimming. It is even and the charge lasts for a good while. I disconnected the power cable about 2 months ago and trimmed yesterday without issue. I'd buy this again without hesitation.
2/16/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	Broke after 3 months.

2/17/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great quality
2/17/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Item as described.
2/17/2018	Amazon	2	Disappointed	"The body trimmer is broken. There's an inner white piece that is missing and is the only attachment that doesn't work, but it's also the main reason why I bought this gift. We assumed there was a charging issue, so we left the product alone for a few days to charge - he gave up and I just noticed this morning why the attachment isn't working - that white piece.  ???? The picture shows a side by side comparison of the white piece in question."
2/17/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great and battery last super long
2/18/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great! Exactly what it said it was.

2/19/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	works well
2/19/2018	Amazon	1	The price is low for a reason.	"This beard trimmers setting leave you with either a very short beard, or too long beard of a beard. It goes in increments of 2 (2-4-6-8). The additional attachments arent an in between size either."
2/19/2018	Amazon	2	Unit works fine when you first get it	Unit works fine when you first get it. But with in the first year the battery dies on you. If your a DIY you can order another battery from Amazon and replace it yourself. The warranty is to much hassle to mess with. By the time you pay for shipping and time lost of not have the clippers to use you can just buy the battery and replace it yourself. Again it works but has a very short product lifespan.
2/19/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works as described
2/19/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	Stopped charging after two months.
2/19/2018	Amazon	5	Great for face and groin	Trims pubes like a champ.
2/20/2018	Amazon	1	Bad Quality	Order arrived and wouldn't function.  Couldn't return it as I missed the window for return as I got busy and had a family issue arise.
2/20/2018	Amazon	5	Great for grooming	"Replaced our old razor, same brand from a few years ago. Love it! Works great!"
2/20/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	Used it twice battery dead. Very displeased with this product not in use for over 10 minutes and will not charge
2/20/2018	Amazon	4	Overall they're pretty good. However	"Overall they're pretty good. However, the plastic pieces are flimsy and break easily. Could have been designed much better, but okay for the price."
2/20/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	good allround trimmer. better than the others i've used
2/20/2018	Amazon	2	... is very short and the battery has only gotten worse in the two years I have used it	This trimmer works well but it's battery life is very short and the battery has only gotten worse in the two years I have used it. I usually on use it once a week and generally charge it for a full day beforehand to be able to use it 5-10 minutes. It will never hold a charge for a day and will not work when plugged in with a dead battery. Two stars for a good selection of attachments and a good blade.
2/20/2018	Amazon	1	very disappointed and grossed out	THIS ARRIVED USED AND UNWASHED. very disappointed and grossed out!

I use it to shave my face and also to touch up the edges when i cut my own hair. It is greatly universal.  Can get in tight spots and the big areas too.
2/21/2018	Amazon	1	P.O.S.	"My original PG525, bought a few years ago, had a nice heavy steel blade assembly.  After I dropped the unit and one of the tiny teeth broke, it nicked my skin, so I bought a replacement blade on Amazon.  The replacement blade was cheap, thin metal that constantly nicked me even without being broken.  So I figured I'd suck it up and buy a whole new PG525, thinking it would come with the same good blade that was on the original unit.  Wrong.  When it arrived yesterday, I could see through packaging that the blade assembly on the PG525 is now the same cheap junk as the replacement blade I already tried.  Without ever opening the package, I clicked ""return item,"" only to get a message saying ""this item isn't eligible for return.""  I'm glad it was only $30, and in future I'll buy my ""personal care products"" at local stores."
2/21/2018	Amazon	4	Great trimmer for adjusting length. Terrible as a shaver.	"This is a great detail trimmer, whether it's the beard, mustache or sideburns. The body hair add on is great for getting the length just right. However the foil shaver is garbage. Don't think you'll be able to shave with this thing."
2/21/2018	Amazon	5	... my husband he loves it Is it to use love the fact that I has a	Got it  for my husband he loves it Is it to use love the fact that I has a charger
2/21/2018	Amazon	3	Was much happier with previous brand I had	"Charge seems to last only a few shaves even though charged for full 24hs. Was much happier with previous brand I had. Front comb is too large for precise trimming, it'd be nice to have an alternative head."
2/21/2018	Amazon	5	Great for daily beard grooming and manscaping	Great for daily beard grooming and manscaping. Keeps the charge for a long time between times to recharge the battery.

I had my first one for about 6 six months before it unexpectedly stopped turning on. I bought this one in hopes that it would last only to have it quit working on the SECOND USE!!! And the worst part is that I didn't need it till about a month after I bought it, so I can't return it... Don't buy Remington!!!"
2/22/2018	Amazon	5	very happy with purchase	awesome for the price! for ANY body hair removal.  will update if needed but so far so good (3 weeks of 3 uses)
2/22/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	This trimmer met and exceeded my expectations HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
2/22/2018	Amazon	1	Decent shaver/Horrible Battery	"I bought this shaver a little under a year ago and enjoyed the ease of use and price point. However, it has stopped charging and dies out within 30 seconds of use. No matter how long charge it, nothing holds. This is frustrating as I shave everyday and didnt expect the product to die out this quickly. The price was right, but the reliability discounts that very quickly."
2/23/2018	Amazon	5	Very versatile and battery holds a charge!	"Very impressed with this product, has lot's of versatility and holds a charge very well!  I was hesitant to get another Remington due to battery issues, but so far, loving it!"

2/24/2018	Amazon	3	"Lots of accessories, shave not the closest."	"Good value, the foil shaver doesn't seem to shave very close, trimmer works well. Good amount of accessories."
2/24/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	Not a good shave.
2/25/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	My boyfriend said it works great.
2/25/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	The item is broken and no longer charges. Maybe used 10-12 times
2/25/2018	Amazon	5	Exactly what I expected.	Purchased this newer model since the one I bought 10 years ago or so was falling apart. Works great so far!
2/26/2018	Amazon	5	Great for the downstairs too!	I bought this on the suggestion of Amazon reviews. By far the best reasonably priced trimmer I have ever owned.

2/27/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	It didn't work
2/27/2018	Amazon	4	It's okay.	It's mostly okay. The main reason for buying it was the attachments to around side burns. I was really hoping the shaver attachment would be better. I'm not sure it really works that well at all.
2/27/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	"excellent product, no longer have to pay my barber extra to work on the beard."
2/27/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Love this product and great seller! Will be buying again!
2/28/2018	Amazon	1	The cutting blades feel like they weren't sharpened	"I bought this for my husband and after a couple of uses, he is ready to chuck it and look for another one.  The cutting blades feel like they weren't sharpened.  They pull the hair instead of gliding through his beard."
2/28/2018	Amazon	2	Basically a toy...	"This is basically a toy.  Possibly good for trimming a goatee or a beard, but the foil shaver is a joke.  This does not have sufficient power for head hair and if it did it would take forever as the trimmer head is so narrow.  Returning this for sure."
3/1/2018	Amazon	3	I think you'd be better off spending another $10-20 to upgrade to a higher ...	You definitely get what you paid for.  Feels cheap but will do the job and has many attachments.  Not a fan of the nose trimmer but for clipper use I would say it does the job.  I think you'd be better off spending another $10-20 to upgrade to a higher quality set though.
3/1/2018	Amazon	3	Three Stars	GOOD
3/1/2018	Amazon	4	Good trimmer	Good for trimming. The shaving attachment doesn't impress me.
3/1/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	My husband loves it!
3/2/2018	Amazon	5	Much better than expected	"I got this just to trim my beard when I couldn't get to the barber often enough. It was not expensive, so I was very surprised to find it works very well indeed. And so do all its many attachments.  I found I could do better than the barber ever could and haven't gone back since."
3/2/2018	Amazon	3	Ok but dont waste your time	No real cutting power
3/2/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great.

3/2/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Since i bought it about 2 weeks ago i still havent charged it. its still powerful tho.
3/2/2018	Amazon	5	Love this trimmer	"We've had this more than 6 months and it's still going strong.  Great buy, looks kinda flimsy but works great. My husband has really coarse facial hair and it still cuts well."
3/2/2018	Amazon	4	Not the best trimmer. But definitely very good	Had too high expectations. Not the best trimmer. But definitely very good.

3/5/2018	Amazon	4	"Great product, for a first time beard grower I ..."	"Great product, for a first time beard grower I couldnt have asked for more. As I had more time to improve my grooming kit I noticed how the clipper attachment does not cuz as sharp as others, more expensive tools, but this was to be expected. I would recommend this product as a travel kit that, if lost, can be easily replaced but also does its job well."
3/5/2018	Amazon	1	"The item will not recharge, I plug in and ..."	"The item will not recharge, I plug in and the green lights do not come on and no charging happens. I realize I bought this a year ago but regardless it should last longer this it has."
3/6/2018	Amazon	4	All the attachments work great	"It cuts hair fairly well, but doesnt edge quite as sharp as other trimmers Ive used. All the attachments work great though"

3/7/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	I literally used this product 2 times and it stopped working.
3/7/2018	Amazon	4	Great beard/hair clipper	"Bought this Remington as my beard and hair was getting too long. I bought it as I find the guides on hair clippers to be too long for under the nose. This clipper's guides are just right they do not poke into the nose at all. It is very sharp and makes short work of a beard or regular hair, i would recommend this product for anyone looking for a beard/hair clipper."
3/7/2018	Amazon	5	Fantastic trimmer! Cuts low and never snags	Fantastic trimmer! Cuts low and never snags. Much better than the other Remington cheaper models. Well worth the extra $10.
3/7/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great
3/7/2018	Amazon	2	"I love the trimmer itself but the ""fins"" on the adjustable ..."	"I love the trimmer itself but the ""fins"" on the adjustable guide started falling off one at a time until that accessory could no longer be used. (About 11 months) It's unfortunate because it was the main reason I bought the kit. I have owned the exact same kit and used it for over 5 years before the adjustable guide on that one broke and the battery started holding a shorter charge. (Still long enough to use for 8 minutes or so if charged between uses). This time the adjustable guide didn't last nearly as long. I'm not sure if they changed the material or not as I threw the old guide out. If you don't care about the adjustable guide accessory, this is a fantastic kit."
3/7/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	Not sharp.
3/7/2018	Amazon	5	Great razor!	Second one I have owned.  Great razor!
3/8/2018	Amazon	5	Great little shaver	"I really like the features! I was worried that this was kind of a gimmecky shaver with all of the attachments, however they're all easy to swap out, easy to clean, and most importantly, they work! The foil is only useful for tidying up after trimming with the larger trimmers, but that's to be expected and not worth knocking a star off for. This tames some intense hair and is useful for face and other regions. Great little cordless shaver, really. note- I have not used the nose trimmer yet."
3/8/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	Broke after 2 months
3/9/2018	Amazon	4	Gets the job done	Pretty much what you can expect out of a device in this price range. I use to trim my beard and it gets the job done. Usually have to buy a new one every year or so since the blades get dull.
3/9/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	The product does not hold a charge. Do not buy!
3/9/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"best hair groomer I found, still on first charge, months after purchase."
3/9/2018	Amazon	1	I used properly but it stopped working after 5 months ...	"I used properly but it stopped working after 5 months without any reason. If you have a choice, buy from different brands."
3/9/2018	Amazon	5	Well worth the money	For the money this is amazing and nice size battery is long but the shaver works super slow so you might need a separate shaver trimmer works perfectly
3/9/2018	Amazon	5	BEST TRIMMER i EVER USED	"After going through 4 other sinilarly priced trimmers and not being very happy with any of them I gave this one a shot. I'm very pleased with it in every way. It just works. Exactly as advertised. Quality construction, long running battery, strong motor, and easy change attachments. All at a great price. Buy it, you won't be sorry."
3/10/2018	Amazon	3	Trimmer guard slips easily.	"Biggest complaint:  the trimmer guard slips easily from one setting to another, so I wound up trimming a chunk of my goatee off. when I was just trying to trim it gently.  I thought maybe I was pushing too hard, but it happened more than once and I was being really careful.  Also, I have to make a few passes over the same hair before it's sufficiently trimmed."
3/10/2018	Amazon	3	Three Stars	"Its OK for the price. However, the raiser is not really that effectively to remove completely the beard."
3/10/2018	Amazon	1	Simply lousy at cutting hair - and the manufacturer is oblivious	"Simply lousy at cutting hair.  It takes several passes to trim my mustache, and for general shaving clear areas I basically have to scrub the area with this shaver to get a clean shave.  I bought this model because of the lithium battery and the appearance that it had LEDs for charge status - but the green LED stripes are not a charge indicator - there's just one light behind the three stripes.  This shaver is going into the recycle pile and I'm going to have the battery in my old Condor shaver replaced...  Remington asked me to contact them - to what end?  The all the parts are moving as designed, the foot's just too thick to get a close shave."
3/10/2018	Amazon	4	Ultimately had to return	"I liked this product at first.  the form factor, the travel aspect as that's actually what I purchased it for.... however, when to charge for first time and simply would not charge.  Now I've discovered that my return is via a check?  and the price has gone up?  Kind of disappointed.  but since I need one for an upcoming trip going to trust that the return refund is prompt and the next one doesn't have the same issue!"
3/10/2018	Amazon	4	Basic and easy to use	"Basic and easy to use. I'm able to keep my beard trimmed without having to spend a lot of time in front of the mirror. The company was very helpful when I had a problem with one of the shaving heads, replacing it without question. Good product."
3/11/2018	Amazon	1	"After 3 months, clippers won't hold a charge enough ..."	"After 3 months, clippers won't hold a charge enough to clean up the back of my neck. 30 seconds and it shuts off. When you plug it in, it shows its charging."
3/12/2018	Amazon	5	I am really happy as is he	"Arrived on time , got it for hubby as he always dreads using typical razors, I am really happy as is he . He trimmed his thick beard with no trouble and in a lot less time. He really liked the way it worked as well as all the attachments he has also used ! Very pleased customer !"

".....So not entirely sure whether I had been given one of the devices not intended to work beyond its first battery charge, but finally reached this moment just months after purchasing. Can I be offered some assistance concerning this matter?  Overall, this product is great as it doesn't pinch like other products and the overall performance handles my furry-face with ease.  Sincerely, a distant Peace Corps Volunteer."
3/17/2018	Amazon	2	Poor quality - Don't buy	"I have used this now for a couple of months and am sorry I bought it.  The charge indicator never changes color to know if it is done, the motor always sounds like it is going to quit, the organizer tray looks great in the picture but does not hold the items in place, and now the adjustable guide has broken.  Don't buy this."
3/17/2018	Amazon	1	waste of my money!	"waste of money trimmer. none of other trimmer pieces even cut hair as they say... for example the nose/ear piece... does not cut even 1-2 hairs. same goes for the close skin one, does not cut. very poor garbage trimmer. i do NOT recommend this."
3/17/2018	Amazon	1	The charger doesn't work	"Remington PG6025 All-in-1 Lithium Powered Grooming Kit, Trimmer (8 Pieces)Worked OK until the initial charge was gone.  The charger does not work.  Tested with a voltmeter. Nothing. Amazon return window closed the day it was delivered."
3/17/2018	Amazon	2	Seems Underpowered when Using Attachments.	"Sorry, but I had to return this. The kit seems nice, but it felt woefully underpowered when running, say, the nose clipper.

3/20/2018	Amazon	4	Smaller than expected.	"Too small for the purpose I had intended. Good for what it is, but I thought it would be bigger, much like every OTHER trimmer I have owned."

3/20/2018	Amazon	1	Worked pretty good but not for long!	"I'm really enjoying this product.  I have a goatee with stubble for my beard. I really like the attachments and the ease in which they can be changed.  It trims with excellence.  So far, all of the trimmers are fantastic.  Ear/nose attachment is so smooth and doesn't pull at all.  The shaver actually shaves very smooth and is great for my neck.  The only ding on this product is the fact that the power plugs directly into the shaver instead of into the holder.  It would be nice to just sit the shaver on the holder and have the device charge instead of having to unplug the device every time you need it.  Not a huge deal, but having this would give it 5 stars.  Update: trimmer completely died. Bought it in March 2018 and in January 2019, it stopped charging. Wont work at all. In addition, it became tiresome trying to keep everything on the stand. If you grabbed the shaver, several things would fall off. I just dropped it in the trash and Im going to get something much simpler."

3/22/2018	Amazon	5	Remington PG6025 is excellent??	"The Remington PG 6025 All-in-1, is excellent??  It provided an excellent shave. I wear my head bald and it took every bit of hair off my head just like I hoped it would do. I recommend the Remington PG6025 All-in-1, 100%."
3/22/2018	Amazon	5	"Cuts smooth, holds a charge,"	"Very happy with this. Cuts smooth and holds charge a long time. Month between trips, sitting in my toiletry kit it's still good to go for my next travel session."
3/22/2018	Amazon	4	works well	would like a faster speed but what can you expect for the price and battery driven....attachments all do a decent job...smallest trimmer is a little lame.

Lasts maybe one or two trims. Overall it isn't impressive at all. If you want to charge it for a day prior to using it then get it, if not then I'd go with another brand like a wahl. Similar price much better quality."

3/25/2018	Amazon	2	"Used twice, never turned on again."	"Was surprised with how well it works given that it's on the cheaper side. After 2 uses, it won't turn back on. I've charged it, the light still turns green, and I've tried turning it on while plugged in. Nothing. Very disappointed. Guess I'll just have to shell out a little more for a good, durable clipper."
3/25/2018	Amazon	5	Good Product!	"This is SO much better than the set up I used before to trim my beard.  I use regular clippers for the main part of my beard, and use this for the edges and such.  The foil razor part works great."
3/25/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works super
3/25/2018	Amazon	1	I would love my money back	We only used this product 10 times total in 1 year and it stops working even after charging it will not cut back on
3/25/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	not as expected.
3/25/2018	Amazon	2	Disposable shaver	"Bought wanting a shaver that I didn't need to worry about concerning the charge ""memory"" that NiMH batteries have.  Worked for a year. During that time, it cut well, looked good, and the attachments connected well and stayed sharp.  After the year, the battery didn't charge and refused to hold a useful amount of it, so it went in the bin. Ironically enough, went back to an old NiMH shaver that still goes nicely - so much for the memory effect."
3/26/2018	Amazon	5	Love it!	Amazing for the price! Used it everyday and has worked perfectly!

3/27/2018	Amazon	5	"Good producto, good seller"	"Good producto, good seller. the only problem is the foil shaver, it is damaged very fast, it only lasts a month, and I can not find the replacement. I need two replacements and buy two machines, if you can help me, I thank you. regards"
3/27/2018	Amazon	2	full charge doesn't last more than 15 minutes	"Only reason 2 stars instead of 1 is because at least it lasted longer than the cordless Wahl pos that quit working after 3 uses.  Very disappointed in this one after a few months of use, a full charge won't last much past half of my beard trimming session.  Other small features I wish were more like older trimmers.  Because of this one I have decided to never buy another cordless groomer."
3/27/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Trims ear and nose hair very easily.

3/28/2018	Amazon	5	Great deal on a trimmer that works great!	What a deal!
3/28/2018	Amazon	3	Three Stars	"It was missing a part, buts its okay"
3/28/2018	Amazon	1	"Very brittle adjustable comb, but trimmer works well."	"The trimmer works as expected, but the plastic that the adjustable comb is made of is much more brittle than the fixed black plastic combs. I already had two teeth just fall out of the adjustable comb for no apparent reason. Replacement combs are half the price of a new trimmer set, so I would recommend a different trimmer until they either change the material for their adjustable comb or significantly lower the price of the replacement combs. It likely costs about 50-cents to make them, and they sell them for $10. My guess is that its intentional: sell the trimmer with a much lower markup, knowing that the combs will break, then sell the replacement combs at ridiculous markups, knowing that customers will either have to pay it or buy a whole new trimmer."
3/29/2018	Amazon	2	NOT a charging stand.	"Seems to work fine, but Remington was deceptive about the stand. It doesnt match the picture exactly and ABSOLUTELY IS NOT a charging stand. Cord plugs into the bottom of the trimmer and it simply rests on the stand."
3/29/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great quality.  Worth the money.  Battery last longs.
3/29/2018	Amazon	4	Great price...	"Nice features, works well and reasonably priced..."
3/29/2018	Amazon	1	poor battery life.	"Have owned and used this since August of 2017.  When I first got it, it was Ok, not as good as another brand I had used in the past, but seemed serviceable.  BUT... the battery is not holding a charge, so it is unusable 7 months later."
3/30/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	Didnt last more then one time
3/30/2018	Amazon	3	A bit dissapointed.	It does not shave as close as the older product I replaced. It works OK but does not trim my mustache area well and I need to carefully trim with a razor afterward. Sort of defeats the purpose.

4/1/2018	Amazon	2	Must first be charged even when used while plugged in	"After about 1 year of use (with approximately two face shaves per week) even when plugged into the wall the shaver only has enough juice to work for about 3 seconds. In order to have enough power to shave the entire face, you must first plug into the wall for approximately 24-48 hours until the shaver is functional. Strange that it isn't able to work while plugged into the wall and it still must be charged first? I don't quite understand it. Would not buy again."
4/1/2018	Amazon	1	Doesnt work on thick hair	Bought this for my boyfriend..however he has very corse hair and didn't work on his beard. May work on someone with thin hair.
4/1/2018	Amazon	5	Outstanding product!	"The trimmer works great. Battery life is outstanding. Delivery was fast. No issue's. Money well spent, I would recommend this product to anyone that has facal hair."
4/1/2018	Amazon	4	Nice for the price	"This was purchased to replace a Remington trimming kit that I purchased around 20 years ago.  The old kit actually still works great, but the foil shaver attachment recently broke, and Remington recently quit selling it, so I really only purchased this one for the foil razor.  I'm still amazed that my old kit still works great after 20 years, and I'll be surprised if this one even comes close, but time will tell and I'll update this review if the new one should stop working soon.  I don't care for the pointed edges on the new trimmer, since that limits how it can be held, but it otherwise seems to work well.  I've yet to use the hair clipper comb attachment, but it seems like it may work well.  I really just purchased it for the foil shaver, which is smaller than the foil shaver on my old Remington trimmer.  Being smaller makes it easier to work in smaller areas, which is nice, but it also seems to pull hair much more than the old one, so it's a trade-off.  I haven't used any of the other attachments and likely won't anytime soon, but seem typical for an inexpensive trimmer.  One thing I might miss is the charging station that came with my old Remington trimmer.  This one comes with a travel bag, instead, which isn't as handy, but I really need to start storing my trimmers in drawers, anyhow.  Overall, it seems like a nice, inexpensive trimmer.  If the battery lasts anywhere near as long as my old one, then it'll be a real bargain.  I've owned a lot of trimmers by various brands and this is a key reason why I'm returning to Remington, because the battery didn't last long with the others.  Update: The foil shaver works well, although it pulls more than the larger one on my old Remington trimmer.  I prefer the older one by leaps and bounds, but the new one does the job.  I have to add that the adjustable comb attachment is quite nice, though.  It's easy to use and it locks into position well, so there's no slipping to different lengths, unlike the cheap one on my old Remington trimmer.  The manual fails to note the positioning lengths, although it seems quite obvious that the numbers represent the length in millimeters.  It has lengths for every even millimeter up to 16mm and I only wish they'd included another one for odd millimeters."
4/1/2018	Amazon	5	Shower safe.	"I have had zero issues since purchasing it. For those that are asking, yes, you can take it in the shower with you. I was hesitant on purchasing this for the reason that it was not made clear if it could've been done."

He use the hair attachment one a week for his head. After a year of use, the battery started slowing down after 15 min of use. This cause not even grooming and he needs to go over and over again true sertain sections of his hair. He can't do at once head and beard anymore. Hair first. Charge 20 min at least, beard after that. You can't use the device with cord attached. It doesn't charge while operating."

"Absolute garbage, I have had several remington shavers in my time and this is by far the worst bit they have made. They should be ashamed to put their name on it. Just because it says the Lithium powered doesn't mean they used any sort of quality battery or that is necessarily has better battery life than non lithiums. It charges slow and doesn't run for as long as they say. I cannot believe it has 4 stars probably because its cheap but dont fall for it."

Today 18/04/2018 at 3:30PM while shaving I noticed the cutting blade not in line with the other fixed blade, it had moved back about 2mm causing it to make a strange noise and not cutting as expected. This proves to me that remington is an inferior product and therefore I will purchase a wahl. I would not recommend this product to anyone because it appears to be made of a porous or weak plastic around the blade area. As you can see the moving blade has dropped if you look closely."

The blades wear out over time and there's not much you can do to sharpen these cheap ones.  I travel a lot for work, so don't want to buy an expensive trimmer just to accidentally leave it in some hotel.  Overall this is a great trimmer for the money.  Some attachments are kind of goofy, but it gets the job done.  Easy to trim your beard or other areas (*ahem*), and so far does a good job without pulling or skipping hairs.  The rechargeable battery is a great feature, but I can't understand for the life of me why they have some proprietary charger cable (well, not proprietary, but a barrel 5V connector) instead of a mirco USB.  This thing charges off 5V, the same as USB.  Everyone has a dozen mirco-usb charging cables around.  Now with this dumb thing I have to make sure I carry the charger with it.  I would give this unit a full 5 stars if it had a USB charger rather than some other 5V charger."

4/21/2018	Amazon	4	Great but narrow shaver	"Works as expected, although the shave attachment is pretty narrow. Great for shaping but not ideal for entire face."
4/21/2018	Amazon	5	Long battery life	"I'm liking the battery life and easy features so far. Good, solid product"
4/21/2018	Amazon	4	One Star	"used very few times and after 4 months stoped working.  05/14/15 After have been contacted by Remington, they sent me a new unit and so far so good, again, I do not use this trimmer on a regular basis, but, their response was great."
4/21/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	good value
4/22/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	NOT GOOD.
4/22/2018	Amazon	3	Too small for head trimming	It was okay just not for the top of the head too small and whispy hair wouldn't go in replaced the rechargeable batteries in my old Remington
4/22/2018	Amazon	4	Works well	The metal bits heat up enough to bother you as you use it. Great for short use and easy enough to clean. The price is great so one can't complain too much. Works as intended and the extra attachments are a bonus.
4/23/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Likes it
4/23/2018	Amazon	3	Just ok	Doesn't always turn on once its unplugged. Have to plug it back in to get it started.
4/23/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	It lasted only one year. Its stopped working.  I can bekive it.
4/23/2018	Amazon	5	I always charge it after using it for best results on next use	"Works very well for $20. Battery life is average, I always charge it after using it for best results on next use."
4/23/2018	Amazon	3	Honest Comparison with Norelco Multigroomer	"I have used Norelco Multi groom series 3100 and another updated 5100 version  and figured i would give it a try to compare. Here are my pros and cons in comparison:  Pros - Lots of attachments, especially the foils to cut close like Norelco - Attachments have a more secure than the Norelco. A few times my Norelco attachment has popped off which can be dangerous. -Waterproof - Longer battery life  Cons - Motor is not as strong as the Norelco. - My Norelco cuts closer and easier. I have to retrace the same areas multiple time to get similar results with this Remington  Being that the prices are similar when you catch a good sale on the Norelco, I will be going back. The Remington battery life is better but I prefer a better shave. Overall the remington is a good buy, but not my winner in comparison."
4/23/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Love it!
4/23/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Nice razor. Battery stays charged for a long time.
4/23/2018	Amazon	5	Good after a year	"Have had it for over a year and it's pretty much what I bargained for. Only one little glitch is that it sometimes won't turn on after charging but just unplug it, plug it back in and it works."
4/24/2018	Amazon	3	"Got this for my husband, he loves all the ..."	"Got this for my husband, he loves all the attachments, but he said the blades don't cut very well, there is still alot of hair left behind as compared to the old trimmer he was using"

4/24/2018	Amazon	2	"The trimmer is great, but the cheap holder that I paid extra ..."	"The trimmer is great, but the cheap holder that I paid extra for is a waste of money, the parts don't even click in or anything, I ended up having to use a ziploc"
4/24/2018	Amazon	4	Great buy!!	Works pretty well!! Doesn't snag and trims like a professional trimmer. Lot's of useful accessories
4/24/2018	Amazon	1	Junk	Junk.  Stopped taking a charge and wouldn't work plugged in.  Tray is clumsy and when plugged in to charger won't lay properly in tray.  There's only one place for a thing like this...the trash bin.
4/24/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	Product didn't work... Never turned on.
4/24/2018	Amazon	2	"Awkward and cumbersome, broke after a few uses"	"Pros: + Consistent trim + Battery life is great  Cons: - Plastic guard broke after a few uses - Plastic guard is awkward and time consuming to set properly - Trimmings catcher clogs way too quickly and needs to be removed, cleaned (and guard re-configured) multiple times each trim"
4/25/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Well made works great
4/25/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great. Remember to keep it oiled!
4/25/2018	Amazon	5	Best cheap trimmer for my money	"Best cheap trimmer I've ever used, hands down. Smart sideways beard trimmer blade, quiet operation, naked clipper blade does a pretty decent job for head shaving and doesn't cut."
4/25/2018	Amazon	5	Cuts	"Works well,lasts quite awhile on a charge"
4/25/2018	Amazon	1	I have thinner than average hair. It takes way ...	I have thinner than average hair. It takes way too many passes to groom my goatee.  But i bought it and was committed... Guide teeth broke tonight after 8 months use 2 times a week.  Just one at first....i thought I could ignore it.  In same shave 3 more broke off guard.  So basically it became a 0 guard.  Don't trust it on the junk. I actually use the norelco this replaced for that task.  Going to put this one in the dog kit i guess and switch brands
4/25/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	good battery power
4/26/2018	Amazon	5	Works great. Excellent price.	Works great. Excellent price. Seems to be durable construction.
4/26/2018	Amazon	3	There are better ones out there	It works. There are better ones out there.
4/26/2018	Amazon	3	Decent	For what you get for the money its not bad battery is good on mine plus for that price its not your philips norelco but its good for beard trimming and stubble but the foil shaver attachment they give you for me is absolute trash but decent product good for the price
4/26/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great. Would recommend!

Left it on overnight and in the morning it was still dead. Light comes on when plugged in but it is just dead. Didn't even get to use this for more then 1 charge."
4/29/2018	Amazon	1	Died After One Month	Item Died after one month.  I owned this same thing for 2 years before that one broke. This new one was used 3 times before dying.
4/29/2018	Amazon	5	Its still works great and no rusting or anything	My bf loves it... had it for about 8 months. Its still works great and no rusting or anything. Great buy.

4/30/2018	Amazon	3	but hair gets caught very easily and bogs the motor down	"Works okay, but hair gets caught very easily and bogs the motor down. I wish it was a little more powerful for had a better way to eject the hair while shaving."
4/30/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Received as ordered, all A++++"
5/1/2018	Amazon	4	It will get pretty warm if you're doing a big job but haven't had any issues so far.	"I've used this for several months and I like it. The battery lasts a long time and the attachments it comes with allows me to do all the facial grooming needed with one shaver. I still use a regular razor for the clean shaven areas but beard, mustache, eyebrows and ears are all quickly taken care of with this. It will get pretty warm if you're doing a big job but haven't had any issues so far."
5/1/2018	Amazon	5	Works really good. Does not snag on facial or body hair	Works really good. Does not snag on facial or body hair.  I got the newer PG6027 model on sale for around $18. It has 70 minutes battery life and 5 Snap-On Beard and Stubble Combs (2 extra sizes)..Very happy
5/1/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great.
5/2/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	works as advertised
5/2/2018	Amazon	5	Acceptional razor for the price	This shaver is a decent product. After using it for a few months it does have power issues making it less effective. The guards are a nice feature and it comes with a nose hair trimmer as well as a foil trimmer for a close shave. Overall a good product just a few minor issues.
5/2/2018	Amazon	3	"Worked great for 2 months then stopped charging, after trying to send it back, it was easier to buy another."	"Last one I got lasted 2 months, liked it so much when it worked I bought another ASAP, easier than trying to return for the price."

"This product worked great for the first few times I used it (maybe a total of 7 or 8 times just to shave the hairline on the back of my neck), but then it broke. I can hear pieces rattling around inside and it no longer functions."
5/3/2018	Amazon	5	but this exact model is insanely amazing. I've had many upon many sets of clippers ...	"I didn't buy this set from Amazon I got mine at Wal-Mart, but this exact model is insanely amazing. I've had many upon many sets of clippers throughout my lifetime, this is hands down the best one I've ever had to date.  Edit: One thing I forgot to mention was it's battery life. It came fully charged, but it died and then I charged it again, I haven't charged it since and that was like almost 4 months ago and it's still running on the same charge. I use it once or twice every week or so.  But this product and you will not be disappointed.  I'd recommend this to anyone who shaves consistently a couple times during the week. Definitely a 5 star product and the price is unbeatable."
5/3/2018	Amazon	4	Everything is good except the body trimmer	The body trimmer doesn't work as good as I expected but overall it's an excellent product for the price
5/3/2018	Amazon	5	Best Trimmers	Remington makes the best beard trimmers. They die after a year or two but they work the best and they are affordable.
5/3/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	great product  fast delvery
5/3/2018	Amazon	5	Get's the job done	Great clippers. Comes with a number of handy attachments....gets the job done!
5/3/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Nice doesn't give a clean smooth shave
5/4/2018	Amazon	1	Remington used to be a great brand...	Not thrilled with this. The clippers seemed dull and barely lined up my beard. The nose hair trimmer simply doesnt work. Used it for 10 mins in every direction I could manage and still saw all the same hair as before. Remington used to be a great brand. I even worked for them in my youth. Very disapointed.
5/4/2018	Amazon	2	Buy something else if you want battery operated	"Only worked with cord right outta the box. It's also under powered, that's WITH it plugged in."
5/4/2018	Amazon	1	Lasted one month.	"Lasted just over a month and used once a week. Not a very good buy. When it worked it was great, then it suddenly died."
5/5/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Works great but not impressed with the nose hair trimmer.
5/5/2018	Amazon	5	Expediancy & Quality	"Absolutely as described, Brand new in packaging, Extremely Fast delivery, just what the doctor ordered. My Sasquach days are over..."
5/6/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	"Good value for the price, would by again thank you."
5/6/2018	Amazon	5	FAR better than the rotary units.	"This little guy will take hairs down to skin level, unlike the rotary units. I can work on my ears and nose, and not have to mess with them, again, for another three to four days. The rotary unit I had required every other day attention. So far, as of May, 2018, this is an outstanding unit.  Highly Recommended."
5/6/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Good attachments, easy to use and charge."
5/6/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	great product
5/6/2018	Amazon	4	Nice Trim	"So this product works well on those sensitive areas for women. A man's trimmer seems to work better for us women than the frilly girly products. Plus men tend to pay less than women and if your like me you don't need every product to be pink that's annoying. I don't even like pink I like red and black and grey that's it basically and not into white shows dirt too easily and also gets dirty easily as well. I prefer black goes well with everything. I like the extra accessories it came with as well. There are multiple purposes for them all for women trust me. Thanks, it's actually not rough on my skin or on the hair it's trimming away and doesn't cause me any bumps."
5/6/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Best razor kit for a clean stubble cut. (Supposedly most attractive cut for the ladies ????)
5/7/2018	Amazon	1	Arrived used.	I bought one of these and it arrived used. Friggin gross.
5/7/2018	Amazon	5	Well made	Super Product.
5/8/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	It's a very powerful tool and has been going strong for months now.
5/8/2018	Amazon	4	Hey. it does trim your beard and hair. WOW	So far so good
5/8/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Excellent groomer for my teenage son. He has no complaints.????
5/8/2018	Amazon	5	Really sharp!	My boyfriend needed a new trim kit so I got him this. He says it's really sharp so...be careful this is sharp.
5/8/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	I like it. I use it a lot of personal grooming.
5/9/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	works great...battery charge lasts a long time
5/9/2018	Amazon	4	Generally very happy with this	"Generally very happy with this, the shaver is a little narrow and so it takes a little longer to trim the beard. Other than that, great!"
5/9/2018	Amazon	1	"The trim is not very good, leaves my beard different lengths/patchy unlike the WAHL ..."	"Blade teeth are too far apart, pulls my beard hair. The trim is not very good, leaves my beard different lengths/patchy unlike the WAHL it replaced after 8yrs. Buying another WAHL"
5/9/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	"Do not buy this product, it is dramatically under Powred and will struggle to trim facial hair."
5/10/2018	Amazon	1	Battery stopped charging in exactly 2 months	"I bought this trimmer after all the positive reviews on March 5th and in exactly 2 months, the battery is not charging when I plug it in. I cannot return the product any more and it is worthless now. And I discovered its inability to charge the hard way - after plugging it in overnight, I was half way through my bi-weekly hair trimming when it suddenly stopped working. I had to go to work with half hair trimmed - very embarrassing!"
5/10/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great!!! The shaver shaves VERY close to the skin. Works as well as a razor.
5/11/2018	Amazon	1	A TERRIBLE TRIMMER! SPEED WOULD VARY UP AND DOWN AND ...	A TERRIBLE TRIMMER! SPEED WOULD VARY UP AND DOWN AND NOW QUITE WORKING ALL TOGETHER JUST LIKE THE TWO PREVIOUS WAHL TRIMMERS I BOUGHT
5/13/2018	Amazon	3	Meh...	My little Panasonic with a AA battery did a better job than this.
5/13/2018	Amazon	1	"Stay away, customer support ignores you and the product broke in 6 months"	"At first this thing was amazing. I gave it a full 5 star review. Then a few weeks ago the main blade fell apart and it stoped working completely.  Contacted customer support, yet they never returned my email. If I could get my money back i would. At least they could do is provide customer service to us."
5/13/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Very good for a mans needs.
5/13/2018	Amazon	3	It cuts well but the battery didn't last and won't keep a charge	Ok so I bought this because I loved it. I had one and it lasted awhile! So I bought it again Oct 15 2017 and it's now May 2018 and it had died on me the batter won't keep charge and it just automatically dies. I'm pretty irittated because I've only had it about 7 months.
5/14/2018	Amazon	3	Three Stars	like battery life and size. attachment plastic brittle and broke a few tines already
5/14/2018	Amazon	4	"Pretty good, quality is alright"	"Pretty good, quality is alright. Have to go over my beard twice to get a clean look but I have very thick hair so should be ok if you don't have thick hair. Well worth picking up for price."
5/14/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	nice
5/14/2018	Amazon	5	Runs strong and lasts long	"Good for beard and foil shaver. The nose/ear trimmer is a bit rough. I don't use it for haircuts, I have a larger trimmer for that. The battery has been holding a charge well and the shaver keeps the same speed until the battery runs out. I get at about a month of shaves per charge. It's not good for the battery to keep it charging. Let it run out. I've had it since August 2017. Still running strong. Worth the $20.oo Don't expect an entire barbershop in a pouch for that price. LOL"
5/14/2018	Amazon	1	Doesnt hold a charge after a few uses	Was great for the first couple uses but now it doesnt hold a charge anymore!! What a waste of money do not buy this product.
5/14/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Perfect
5/15/2018	Amazon	1	Disappointing	Had less than 2 months and the battery failed.
5/15/2018	Amazon	5	Great product	Great purchase works great
5/15/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	this thing doesn't hold a charge even when it was brand new motor runs too slow to cut properly
5/15/2018	Amazon	5	Great grooming set	Husband loves the grooming set.
5/16/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Good so far.
5/16/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	Very dull
5/16/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Nice product
5/16/2018	Amazon	5	Battery Lasts!	"Love the attachments, and is an improvement to the older models. Previously I had an older model shaver but unfortunately I don't grow enough facial hair so I can make a single charge last over a month! Though the older model had a battery that refused to charge after about 6 months but this one holds up a lot better! would recommend to anyone looking for a budget shaver"
5/16/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	Battery died after one charge.
5/17/2018	Amazon	1	SHAVER ARRIVED I COULD TELL PACKAGE HAD BEEN OPEN BEFORE ...	SHAVER ARRIVED I COULD TELL PACKAGE HAD BEEN OPEN BEFORE I CHARGED IT OVERNIGHT AND IT WOULD NOT TURN ON THIS IS MY 2ND PURCHASE OF A RAZOR FROM AMAZON AND SAME RESULTS THEY BOTH DIDN'T WORK
5/17/2018	Amazon	3	It Works on Some Levels and Others - Not So Much.	"The personal trimmer (smallest attachment) is a little rough around the ears and nose areas. The screened attachment for shaving doesn't really work, so much as it just dries out your face. I have not used the hair clippers attachments as me cutting my oewn hair would end in disaster. The larger attachment works really well."
5/18/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works very well!!
5/20/2018	Amazon	5	Good product - the rechargeable battery works very well & ...	Good product - the rechargeable battery works very well & comes with many useful attachments / easy to clean
5/21/2018	Amazon	5	Excellent product. Compact and efficient	Excellent product.  Compact and efficient.  Than you.
5/21/2018	Amazon	1	Stopped working	Stopped working after two months.
5/21/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great
5/22/2018	Amazon	3	3.5 Stars	"For the price, it does have many features and for the most part does its job. However the one thing I really wanted it to do well in was the nose trimmer, which I would say is below average. Its difficult to get the hairs to fall between the blades. If thats a feature youre less concerned about, this product could be a good pick up for your grooming needs."
5/22/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Very good
5/22/2018	Amazon	5	Great!	Great item!  No hair pulling just nice quick and clean cuts!
5/22/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great product. Quick service.
5/22/2018	Amazon	5	Battery runs forever	I have been using this product for 3 years now and battery still runs like new. Very good quality and performance
5/22/2018	Amazon	5	Smooth Operator	"Great package of different functions, works great"
5/23/2018	Amazon	2	Two Stars	This was a re-order but was not the same as original. Clearly inferior.
5/23/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Many attachments. All work very well.
5/23/2018	Amazon	1	Failed battery	"Battery failed after two uses, should've read the comments here. This product is useless, I'm going back to Philips norelco. It lasted forever until I accidentally broke a piece so had to buy this."
5/24/2018	Amazon	5	Works great for what i use it for	Where did all my hair go? Works great for what i use it for!
5/24/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	This barely holds a charge long enough for me to trim my beard.
5/24/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	holds charge great
5/25/2018	Amazon	3	Okay but not great	"It does the job. The blade looks thin and cheap, it is sharp at least for now. the trimmer is a little loud and I wish I could return but more than a month passed. I bought it for trimming mustache and beard"
5/25/2018	Amazon	5	Great Battery Life	I haven't charged it yet since the day i bought it. So I say it going pretty strong.
5/25/2018	Amazon	1	not powerful enough	"Not powerful enough. It felt like it was battery operated, I had to return it."
5/26/2018	Amazon	5	Great Product! It is a steal at the price	Great Product ! It is a steal at the price !!!
5/26/2018	Amazon	5	you get a great cut every time	"This is the 2nd time I've bought this one, and the 1st one lasted nearly 3 years, never pulls on the hairs just slices right through them with no effort. It's perfectly priced, you get a great cut every time. So glad they haven't tried to discontinue it or remake and end up making it worse. highly recommend it!"
5/27/2018	Amazon	5	Excellent quality with lots of nice attachments	Excellent quality with lots of nice attachments. I only use it once or twice a week and the battery lasts a very long time. I use it on my lady parts and it works really well.
5/28/2018	Amazon	1	Do not buy it wont charge	have same problem it was charged when it came i used it for a week it was working well but now it's dead i cannot charge i dont know its battery or its the wire
5/28/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Perfect. I'm using it often and it works very good.
5/29/2018	Amazon	2	Two Stars	Very small razor head and takes forever to shave.
5/29/2018	Amazon	5	THE best trimmer I've ever had and the price is AMAZING!	"this is truly the best trimmer I've EVER purchased... the price is absolutely unbeatable... I totally see why this item is an Amazon Best Seller and so highly reviewed... I have bought MANY trimmers over the years (and most of them have been all-in-one kits) and they've varied in performance... I mainly use the trimmer for buzzing my head and face/neck down to 1 mm or so (standard military cut for those parts of the year I don't actually shave my head with a triple blade razor... the wife likes when I let my head get velcro-like)... even if this product only gives you a years worth of use, it would still be a great purchase, but I imagine this product will last many years if properly maintained from the get-go... a true winner"
5/29/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great
5/29/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great to the well groomed guy/
5/29/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	great got this to replace my older Bodygroomer
5/29/2018	Amazon	1	it seemed to be a good replacement to my 10 year old Remington	"Well, it seemed to be a good replacement to my 10 year old Remington, but the new one broke after less than 60 days. Just out of warranty, how frustrating! The hard plastic on the main attachment broke when I wasnt even touching it. Crazy! Update: thought I could keep using the other heads, but now the plastic body has cracked. What a total piece of junk! Amazon should take this item off their website."
5/30/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Best bang for your buck.. recommend this and any upgraded versions in the future.
5/30/2018	Amazon	3	Not very powerful	Not very powerful and I have to shave multiple times over. The battery life is on the lower end.
5/30/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works well
5/30/2018	Amazon	1	Product does not work very well. Only used for ...	Product does not work very well. Only used for facial hair and missed hairs even after going over and over side burns.
5/30/2018	Amazon	4	Remington Rules	"Remington Rules!!!  For the last couple of years I used a Norelco QG3331 Series beard trimmer, and it is really junk compared to this Remington. The Norelco was difficult to use and I was never able to get the trimming adapters to fit correctly. The Remington is easy to use, and the carrying pouch is an added boon."
5/31/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Versatil
5/31/2018	Amazon	1	This thing is terrible! It doesnt trim the beard evenly	"This thing is terrible!  It doesnt trim the beard evenly, the attachments are all small & dont work at all - no consistency.  You cant get a close shave at all. Will be getting a different one soon!"
5/31/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"works like a charm, very versitile"
6/1/2018	Amazon	3	I like the groomer very well	I like the groomer very well. I SERIOUSLY dislike the storage tray. It seems to have been designed with the sole purpose of scattering combs & device heads in all directions at the slightest bump.
6/2/2018	Amazon	1	Cheap and useless. Great for ages 12 and under	"This is a sub par trimmer at best. I purchased it, with reservations, and it did not meet any expectations. The only thing it has going for it would be the price, other than that it is lackluster. I'd much rather buy one nice mens shavers than go through any more of these.  I only have grow a short goatee and it had trouble with that. The nose trimmer is a joke as well as all the other attachments. If Remington was getting into the kids toy shavers market then they've done an excellent job with this one. Spend a little more money and purchase something that will actually work."
6/3/2018	Amazon	5	Works Great!	"Nice product, happy with purchase"
6/3/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	"very versatile but plastic guard is cheap, had to replace it"
6/3/2018	Amazon	2	Great while it lasts....which isn't for long	"It worked great while it lasted! I had it for about five months and charged it twice during that time, using it about once a week. However, the third time I tried to charge it (which happened to be while I am abroad), it wouldn't take the charge. I came to Amazon to try to contact the seller, and noticed that many people have had the same problem. Currently shopping for a new model that will last me a longer while once I get back home.  If you only plan on having a beard for a couple of months, give it a try; otherwise, pay a little more for a more durable product."
6/3/2018	Amazon	1	Doesn't do the job	Used it for 5 mintues and hated it immediately. Barely cuts hair let alone trim it effectively. Issued refund immediately.
6/4/2018	Amazon	1	"Bad product, rendered useless because the unit will not ..."	"Bad product, rendered useless because the unit will not recharge after first recharge. I wish I could return it but  the product-return date has elapsed, and moreover Im on vacation in Ghana. Dont buy"
6/4/2018	Amazon	2	Battery is not working. It didn't work for more ...	"Battery is not working. It didn't work for more than 2 months. I bought the same product previously and the recharge battery lasted for more than 1 year.  I got this product again on Jun 8th and kept on charge for 3-4 hours and worked for 1 time say 30 mins and stopped working, It feels like it starts and then stops in like 5-10 secs.  Please suggest me a good product or vendor for this product."

Works good for what I got it for use it on my face and private parts can get a close shave without cutting myself and still leaves the stubby feeling I love it never have sliced myself once I can imagine if your looking to cut your hair on your head with it this isnt the product for you
6/4/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Thanks
6/6/2018	Amazon	5	Great trimmer	"I have had the same trimmer, older model of course, for at least 10 years. It finally quit. I didn't hesitate to purchase this one. I'll be happy if it lasts half as long."
6/6/2018	Amazon	5	Its great for trimming up body hair	"Bought this for my husband, he loves it! Its great for trimming up body hair, and cleaning up his neckline."
6/6/2018	Amazon	1	Horrible: stopped working after less than 3 months using it	"If I could give ZERO stairs, I would have done so. This is the worst beard trimmer I have ever bought. It worked fine for approximately 3 months until it stopped working out of nothing. I did nothing different that could have explained why it stopped functioning. And the company gives a 60-days money back guarantee but not a 90-days so I wonder if they know that their crappy product last longer than the money back eligibility time but not longer enough to qualify as a decent product!"
6/6/2018	Amazon	4	So far so good does a good job for short haircuts and thick ...	So far so good does a good job for short haircuts and thick stubble . You wont get a clean face shave but it all depends on your facial hair. Overall a good buy if you ask me does trimming just fine.
6/7/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	Broke first time using
6/8/2018	Amazon	5	"Good quality, exactly as"	"I buy these all the time for my three boys, it's the only kind they will use and they've tried many. Good quality, exactly as described"
6/8/2018	Amazon	1	DO NOT BUY - died within 2mo	used less than 10 times in the 2 mo I've owned it - wont run at all - appears to charge (light is on) but no motor movement at all
6/8/2018	Amazon	1	Buy something else	"Absolutely useless trimmer. This thing, despite its 3,000 attachments, doesnt trim anything. Buy something else."
6/9/2018	Amazon	1	"Good trimmer, but HUGE issue with battery rendered it useless"	"The trimmer worked really well for the time I had it (~3 months). I mainly bought it to use as a beard trimmer but the extra attachments like the hair trimmers and foil head were a good bonus. Unfortunately, after the first charge ran out, the trimmer would no longer hold a charge at all. I have no idea if this is due to water damage from rinsing the various heads under the sink, or simply an issue with the battery (that many other people in the reviews seem to be having). While the trimmer itself is a good functional piece, having the battery fail after not even a single charge at home is unacceptable, and really destroys the credibility that the product gains from being a good trimmer. After taking the device apart, there was no visible damage so I'm not really sure what the solution would have been."
6/10/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Thank you.
6/10/2018	Amazon	2	Two Stars	Used a few times and then it stopped charging. It cannot hold a charge and doesn't function at all.
6/10/2018	Amazon	1	Junk!	"I bought this based on some glowing reviews......big mistake! The shaving head is very very small about the size of your little fingernail, so shaving takes about half an hour as you have to go over and over and over! The haircutting attachment isn't much better. This is junk and I would love to return it but I didn't know returns were not accepted, otherwise I would never have oredered it. Never again Amazon, I have cancelled my membership as well."

6/11/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	use all the time great
6/11/2018	Amazon	5	Better than the rest in the same price range	"Works fantastically! Trims my beard correctly and all the attachments are great. I only really use three, but I love the options. I also never use the rechargeable function I just plug it in every time I use it, but as far as $20 dollars goes this beats out every other trimmer Ive bought in that price range."
6/11/2018	Amazon	5	Works great!	"As expected from Remington ppl products, great for the price too! I've used their shavers forever, passed down from generations. Only Whal is comparable, but expensive."
6/12/2018	Amazon	5	Perfect for extraneous body hair	"OK, so it's on the small side, and I wouldn't want to shave a full head of hair with it, but, it's perfect for extraneous body hair. If ""small"" = handy, I'll take that trade-off any day."
6/12/2018	Amazon	5	Works great	Great product at a great price.
6/12/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Got this for my husband. He uses it all most everyday.
6/13/2018	Amazon	5	good one	bought for a family member ..they love it..
6/13/2018	Amazon	2	Trim guard tines keep breaking	I've had this for about a year and a half now. A few months ago one of the tines on the trim guard broke off. Today two more did. I wish it had a more sturdy design. This only gets used once or twice a month.
6/13/2018	Amazon	3	Not as good as Id liked	"I like to keep my beard fairly short and was replacing a big clunky Remington that Id had for over 10 years. When I got this one I was pretty happy with the size and weight of it. Makes it easier to maneuver on your face. Has a bunch of attachments that I dont use. The problem is, even on the lowest setting my beard isnt short enough. To top it off, when I take the guard off to trim my mustache the blades arent sharp enough to cut a nice straight line. Ill probably end up getting something else."
6/13/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Worked
6/14/2018	Amazon	5	Trimmed	"Great cutter , trims easy lowest setting is very very close to the skin"
6/14/2018	Amazon	5	Great product	Great product worked well
6/14/2018	Amazon	3	Pretty good qaulity but attachment guage measurements are useless	Pretty good qaulity but attachment guage measurements are useless. A #4 is not a barber #4. You will need to figure out and wing it.
6/14/2018	Amazon	2	Runs slowly...then fast!	"Charged per the instructions.  Shows to be fully charged.  Starts out painfully slow.  Then, may or may not speed up...all on its own"
6/14/2018	Amazon	5	worth three times the cost	does it all without nicks.  outperforms my more expensive remington hands down
6/15/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great
6/15/2018	Amazon	1	Failed within a month.	The battery failed within a month. I wouldnt recommend this product. I tried charging it back but it stays on couple seconds and dies again. Pretty much threw it in the trash.
6/15/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	great product
6/15/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	very good..
6/16/2018	Amazon	1	"Died in less than 3 months, NOT battery issue"	"Good razor, but crapped out in less than 3 months.  Just stopped working.  Took it apart, battery fine, switch fine, electronics must have crapped out"
6/16/2018	Amazon	1	Does not charge.	My product stopped charging after the first use. Such a shame because it trims wonderfully.
6/18/2018	Amazon	5	Love it!	"Absolutely love it. I've had a Norelco for years that cost way more than this and which I had mixed feelings about, and this little gem blows it completely out of the water."
6/18/2018	Amazon	1	Not good if you wanna use without guard.	I like to use trimmer without any guard to shave with so I don't get any razor burn and gives me that nice scruffy look. This trimmer has blades that get closer to skin causing it to cut me multiple times with every use. I had the previous model of this trimmer and gave me perfect results for years. However I don't recommend this one if you like to use without a guard. Luckily I haven't tried to trim my boys with this trimmer.
6/18/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	love it
6/19/2018	Amazon	3	"Meh. Jack of all trades, master of none."	"All the attachments make for at least some breadth in capability, but it doesn't do any one thing particularly well. In particular, small cutting head means multiple passes, and the shortest setting (even unguarded) is not short/clean enough. Battery indicator doesn't seem to do much except show ""charged"" or not. Will probably just linger at the back of my bathroom cabinet."
6/19/2018	Amazon	3	Meh.. It's ok.... For ...	"Meh..  It's ok....  For the price, it, somewhat works..  Not very powerful, seems to take a while to do a face trim...  Personally didn't have any interest in the other attachments..  It's ok....  Personally, think you get what you pay for with razors, shavers, etc..."
6/19/2018	Amazon	2	Two Stars	Did not work to well on curly hair
6/19/2018	Amazon	5	Holds a good charge for long time.	This thing is pretty cool for me hold a good charge. Could not stand the cable anymore this was a good option.
6/19/2018	Amazon	1	This worked fine for about two months	"This worked fine for about two months, and then completely stopped charging. Have had it plugged in for almost a week and it lasted about thirty seconds."
6/19/2018	Amazon	4	A good little trimmer	"A good little trimmer, unfortunately it doesn't get down to the skin to well. For the price though it's not to bad."
6/20/2018	Amazon	5	works great	Works great
6/20/2018	Amazon	5	Good product.	Holds change well and does the job.
6/20/2018	Amazon	5	So happy with product	Great product
6/21/2018	Amazon	4	good value. Changing shaver heads is a bit annoying	"Decent trimmer, good value. Changing shaver heads is a bit annoying."
6/21/2018	Amazon	3	I like having the attachments that are provided as well	The only downside is it takes some work to get through a thicker beard. Upside is that it keeps the same consistent charge the I am using it. I like having the attachments that are provided as well. Depending on what type of beard you have you may want to do a little more research and get something with a little more cutting power.
6/21/2018	Amazon	1	Doesnt hold charge	I would give this items zero stars if I could. Stopped working a week after I got it. Very disappointed by this product
6/21/2018	Amazon	5	"Long battery, doesn't pinch"	Effective beard trimmer.
6/22/2018	Amazon	4	Great trimmer kit	"Nice trimmer with easy attachments. This makes a great on-the-go accessory. This is good for fiber detail work but would not suggest it as a replacement for electric face razor or whole body maintenance. As a supplemental or a back up, works great though"
6/22/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Good Product
6/22/2018	Amazon	5	Amazing	My boyfriend loved this. He normally doesn't like electric trimmers but this one he loved.
6/23/2018	Amazon	5	"Best in price, better than phillips (equivalent)"	"Nice trimmer, Amazing battery and precision. I have used it for months. No problem faced so far."
6/23/2018	Amazon	1	fragile.	"Worked great for short time I used it.  Slid into the sink from the side of the counter and now the trimmer part doesn't work anymore.  This isnt a 3 foot drop, its a small tumble.  I expected better."
6/23/2018	Amazon	2	Idk	I give it two stars because i looking forward to use the foil shavers on this but it doesn't work well have to pass through about 8 times to get it shaved right....not recommended.
6/24/2018	Amazon	1	Dies within 12 months of ownership!	The battery no longer charges after 11months of ownership. Kept this on 4 hour charge and then again 24 hour charge with the same result! This is my second Remington trimmer which has died and not met my expectations!
6/24/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Excellent
6/24/2018	Amazon	1	Didnt last	"6 months and broke, less than average use... disappointed"
6/24/2018	Amazon	5	A+++++	great cut. great finish. long lasting charge.
6/24/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	Worked for about a week and died.
6/24/2018	Amazon	5	"years later, still works."	Trimmer works amazing. Its been a long time since i bought this. And it still works amazing. I have other trimmers that have used snd died. This one is still great and battery life is still amazing.
6/26/2018	Amazon	4	Does what it's supposed to	Does what I need it to. Battery lasts as long as I expected it to. Works great for beard trimming but I wouldn't use this for cutting hair.
6/26/2018	Amazon	5	Works great	I dont have to buy batteries any more Works well does what it has to do
6/26/2018	Amazon	4	Trims	Trims hair. Does what it should.
6/26/2018	Amazon	5	Great product!	"Good product, it is very useful with its different adapters, for those who ask a lot of this, I confirm that yes, works well for the ""private parts"" you should only be careful..."
6/27/2018	Amazon	5	Definitely worth the money!	"Had this for three years to shave my head, trim my beard, and ect it just barely gave up on me, I'm shopping for a new one they're definitely worth the money"
6/27/2018	Amazon	2	a lot of plastic	a lot of plastic don't think it will last long
6/27/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Good value; performs great
6/27/2018	Amazon	5	Nice for the price!	Cuts well. Won't nick if you wet shave.
6/27/2018	Amazon	4	"Small, but powerful and effective."	"Works very well for trimming my beard.  Easy to use, and holds a charge through over 4 trimmings.  Might have gone longer, but I didnt want to have the battery run out in the middle of a trim.  Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is smaller than my last trimmer, which makes controlling it a little more difficult.  But it works great and does a nice job."
6/28/2018	Amazon	2	I'm annoyed that a supposedly good name like Remington delivers such ...	"I'm annoyed that a supposedly good name like Remington delivers such a poor performance.  It just does not cut facial or head hair in one go...you have to go over the same area time and time again to actually cut the hair.  At first I thought it was the smoothest trimmer I have ever used, turns out its because its not actually doing any trimming, just pushing the hair around.  light weight, easy to handle good battery life, been using it for several months now, still disappointed, takes 3 time longer to cut than previous Wahl trimmer....go get  a Wahl!"
6/28/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	works great
6/28/2018	Amazon	4	Great for price	Works great
6/28/2018	Amazon	2	Though it was a best seller but not happy	Worked good for about 10 uses then would not take a charge
6/29/2018	Amazon	4	Not a bad deal	Its smaller than what I thought it was. But it holds a nice charge for quite while and has some handy attachments. I wish it had a charging base but its just a electrical plug
6/29/2018	Amazon	3	NOT a Nose Hair Trimmer!	"Don't buy this for the sole purpose of using it as a nose hair trimmer, it's absolutely terrible for that. For ""manscaping"" and taking care of little touch ups between haircuts, it's adequate but not great. It does get extremely hot, as you'll see in other reviews, but the battery seems to be a monster in mine so I haven't run into that issue like other people have.  I would've given it a 5 if the nose hair attachment wasn't completely disappointing (to the point where I now have to go buy one that does that exclusively), a 4 if it didn't get so doggone hot so quickly; actually, I think I would've landed on 3 either way just because of how disappointed I am with the nose hair trimmer :0\"
6/29/2018	Amazon	1	Didn't last 9 months	9 months in with very infrequent use and it no longer holds a charge. Doesn't even work when plugged in. Not worth the money.
6/30/2018	Amazon	3	"Good, but not great"	"Overall it works well, but the latch that holds the adjustable trimmer at its specified setting is VERY unreliable. Went to trim the back of my neck, and with very little pressure the trimmer slid all the way to the lowest setting, cutting much more than i planned. The latch has very little resistance and is poorly designed. However the rest of the attachments work just fine, so its  not totally useless."
7/2/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Excellent product - Works great, but the bag is too small for all the items that come with."
7/2/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	Husband used it for 4 months before battery stopped holding a charge.
7/3/2018	Amazon	5	Solid & easy to use.	Works beautifully. Trims and cuts with no problem. I had used other products and have had issues. No issues with Reminton.
7/3/2018	Amazon	1	Would NOT recommend.	Never accepted another charge after the first battery charge died. Would NOT recommend.
7/3/2018	Amazon	2	Lacks power. Poor design.	"Not a fan of this trimmer. It sort of lacks the power you'd expect and it would take twice as long to trim my face as the Remington MB-200 takes. Just doesn't grab the hairs in the same effective way. Also, the dial settings are really weird. Instead of having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... it's 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. Just confusing and unnecessary. I returned it and got another MB-200 after my last one broke."
7/3/2018	Amazon	5	this is a great product. I do not often give 5 stars ...	this is a great product. I do not often give 5 stars but this one deserves it. if I don't feel like using the razor the machine does a good enough job. NOT skin level shave mind you but good enough.

7/6/2018	Amazon	3	Two plusses I see here are that this shaver is better constructed and the batter seems to be very long-lasting	"This seems to irritate my skin more than my previous body groomer. I use it to shave my back and even though I cleaned it with alcohol prior to its initial use, my skin reacted poorly and I have a bunch of zits on my back now. I also bought it to groom nose/ear/eyebrow hair and it's definitely acceptable for that. So either it's an expensive nose hair groomer or kind of a sub-par body groomer.  Two plusses I see here are that this shaver is better constructed and the batter seems to be very long-lasting.  My old groomer only ran for about 10 minutes before I needed to charge it again. It's probably worth the $25 I spent on it, but if I had more frequent or extensive needs, I'd probably move up to a better product."
7/6/2018	Amazon	5	Better than the Philips Norelco Bodygroom Series 7100	"Better than the Philips Norelco Bodygroom Series 7100, BG2040 as a body groomer in my opinion. Norelco does not have a lithium ion battery and it is bulky. As a BODY GROOMER (specifically for the groin area) Remington is better for one third of the price!"

It quit working two months ago (April 2018). Google claims that an electric razor should last 3 to 5 years, so 16 months is officially unimpressive. The quality was decidedly meh even in its prime (small cutting area, mediocre battery life), and I won't miss this razor now that it's gone. On the plus side, it's affordable. Proof that you get what you pay for."
7/8/2018	Amazon	1	cheap: stops charging or turning on.	i bought this item twice. the first one lasted 1 year. the second one lasted 6 months. both times seemed rechargeable battery related.  never buying this again.

It does appear to work while plugged in ...	"I have an old remington pg-250 trimmer that has lasted me for years. It has an actual charging stand and storage that is compact with a lid that closes around the trimmer so the attachments don't fall out or get misplaced. The video that Remington shows for the PG525 calls the stand a ""charging"" stand but you can't really charge it while on the stand as you can with other models. Also to store the three combs that come with it one has to slide the teeth of the combs between two slits on the stand to store them so they don't technically fit on the stand because this forces most of the comb to hang off the back of the stand and they are also not very sturdy.  It does appear to work while plugged in but not sure if its charging if you're using it while plugged in as the charging indicator light turns off once you turn the unit on. The attachments snap on and off easy enough and the trimmer seems to do a decent job for its purpose. My recommendation for improvements would be make a stand where the unit can stand up straight so it can actually charge while in the cradle like the PG250 model where the cord was hidden underneath the stand and better storage for the attachments but other than that it seems fine."
7/12/2018	Amazon	4	Actually pretty nice. Still on my first charge after 3 ...	Actually pretty nice. Still on my first charge after 3 months!. The accessory tray that holds all the attachments doesn't hold anything in place. Super close stubble shave with attachments and this does a good job of consistency in the length of my beard if I grow and shave it. The nose hair trimmer sucks.

7/13/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	So far so good. Smooth action and useful attachments.
7/13/2018	Amazon	2	Two Stars	It stopped working. Wont even hold charge.
7/14/2018	Amazon	3	Small blade means it takes more time to trim. Works great otherwise.	This works well but is smaller than I expected. As a result it takes longer to trim a beard than some of the bigger shavers from Remington. I am fine with it since I only trim once a week. The battery lasts a very long time and I charge it maybe once a month to every other month and have never had it run out. A daily user may need to do so more frequently. The comb pieces provide good options for length control. And the pouch helps keep everything organized.

7/14/2018	Amazon	5	If you need a Trimmer Don't Look Any Further...	Great Price and Performance...
7/14/2018	Amazon	1	Product stopped working after 60 days!	"Although the device worked fine for my purposes at first, it ultimately stopped.  My best guess is that the charging circuit is nonfunctional and that the initial battery life was all that was causing it to work (I only used it to trim hard-to-reach areas on my face).  Although this says a lot for the battery life, the quality control is obviously very poor.  If Remington would send me another, I'd give it another chance.  But a product that only functions for 60-90 days is a very poor product indeed!!!"
7/14/2018	Amazon	1	Dont waste your money	Ive been using this trimmer for awhile and now it is severely disappointing. It has little to no power and barely trims my mustache. Stay away from this one.

7/16/2018	Amazon	4	Lots of options with this	Works great. Had a charge right out of the box. Like the options with the multiple heads and the cost. Compared to others twice expensive I'll take this everytime hands down.
7/17/2018	Amazon	1	"Nothing like my old Remington trimmer, but what is?"	"This unit is extremely under powered. It struggles trimming my  goatee. The first charges lasted for several trimming. I believe I charged this unit three times, but it may have been four, before it ceased charging forever. I dont recommend this unit."
7/18/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	"Pretty good for the money. Not high end for sure, but gets the job done."
7/18/2018	Amazon	5	Does exactly what its supposed to do	"Replacing a trimmer that finally broke ( after about 10 years)..Remington quality, says it all"
7/18/2018	Amazon	1	Underpowered trimmer; wish I got something better	"Ive had the trimmer for about a week, and Ive tried using it a couple times, but its so underpowered that I cannot really get even short hairs to cut easily. The direct blade (no guards attached) also doesnt get very close. The trimmer has not nicked/cut me yet, but it makes a lot of noise and it does get very warm. I was hoping for this to be great (I did a lot of comparison shopping), but I wish I either went for a Norelco or something else. It seems like everyone either loves this or hates it, so maybe there is just a quality control issue."
7/19/2018	Amazon	5	Remington	"Works excellent, charge lasts long to, love the attachments"
7/19/2018	Amazon	1	Horrible	Horrible. Bought it May 6th and the battery is already dead. Even when plugged in the thing simply does. It work.
7/19/2018	Amazon	5	Works great	Been a good deal so far
7/20/2018	Amazon	1	Bad quality	"Not very reliable, willlast two months tops"
7/20/2018	Amazon	5	I really like it.	"This kit is great. Ive had it for several months and been putting off the review..  It took me awhile to get use to this smaller cordless unit since I was using the corded Whal for eons. It takes a bit longer, but going cordless makes it easier to use more often for quick touch ups.. trimming or just shaving it all off.."
7/20/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	I bought this for my son and he loved it. Thanks for a good product.  Y. Desuza.
7/20/2018	Amazon	5	Versatile razor for home or travel.	Great for the RV.  I use this everyday while on the road in my camper.  One charge lasts around a week.  Remington makes quality product
7/21/2018	Amazon	5	I don't use it all the time but it does a great job on what it's designed to do	I have had this for a couple of months and have only charged it once. I don't use it all the time but it does a great job on what it's designed to do. Well worth the money I spent on it!
7/21/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great stuff.
7/22/2018	Amazon	5	Best product ever	Perfect design
7/22/2018	Amazon	5	Love	"Very practical, Love it"
7/22/2018	Amazon	5	Remington lo mejor!	"Me gusta mucho! Es lo ultimo, por que dura mucho y no se descarga tan fácil. Es súper cómodo para las afeitadas. Muy bueno este articulo !"
7/23/2018	Amazon	1	Stopped working after a couple months	"It worked well while I had it. I purchased it May and by August it had stopped working. I like the attachments. The multi-size piece is pretty bad, but the other pieces are decent. I used it then put it on it's stand for a few days. When I went to is it again it just didn't turn on."
7/23/2018	Amazon	3	It was amazing product. My brother enjoyed it a lot	It was amazing product. My brother enjoyed it a lot. He has been using it over 2 year. Nice and reasonable price.
7/23/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Okay product but I think better products not there then this. Just didn't have enough power than I expected
7/23/2018	Amazon	5	Great product for an amazing price	Quick shipping. Well made product and arrived as described. Very happy with the purchase.
7/24/2018	Amazon	2	"Bought this product before. Cheap, but works for ..."	"Bought this product before. Cheap, but works for about 2-3 months and then breaks. Do yourself a favor and get a Wahl trimmer"
7/24/2018	Amazon	2	Poor quality	The clip holding the guard in place broke after probably 20 uses.
7/24/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great
7/24/2018	Amazon	5	and the many attachments are easy to attach and use	"Does it's job well, and the many attachments are easy to attach and use."
7/25/2018	Amazon	5	Awesome	Great beard trimmer. Good long charge. Great price. Recommend for sure.
7/26/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Very good. I find a little more difficult doing just the touch ups to my old trimmer.
7/27/2018	Amazon	5	perfect	perfect
7/27/2018	Amazon	5	Cool tool	I love it's rechargeable....multi tools. .
7/28/2018	Amazon	4	The adjustable trimmer head is very nice. All in all a good bargain for the ...	Works very well to keep beard and sideburns in check.  The adjustable trimmer head is very nice.  All in all a good bargain for the price.
7/29/2018	Amazon	3	"Hmmm, not sure why I'm sitting on the fence here."	"Hmmm, Don't know ... it doesn't seem to get the job done as well as I was expecting it too. I have used most of the attachments and found that, and i'm being honest here, i can achieve pretty much exactly the same level of detail cutting with another well known brand large hair clipper set.. The battery is good and lasts a good couple of details cuts before needing recharging. its works ok, for the price."
7/29/2018	Amazon	1	One Star	Over heating.
7/29/2018	Amazon	5	"Good power, works great."	Best rechargeable shaver ive used. Attachments are perfect. Long lasting battery.
7/29/2018	Amazon	5	quality construction	"It's a grooming kit, not much to say other than it is well built and does as intended."
7/29/2018	Amazon	4	Clip Away	"Would've been excellent if it came with a stand for the clipper. With that out of the way, it's a great product."
7/29/2018	Amazon	5	... purchased this groomer in May and so far so good. I use it at least every other day ...	"I purchased this groomer in May and so far so good.  I use it at least every other day for moustache, beard, and sideburns and had to only charge it once, so the battery holds a charge for a good amount of time.  All the attachments work great, my only complaint would be that I wish it had more moustache-beard attachments.  The stubble one is too short and the next one is too long so I'm forced to use the hair trimmer.  At least I can adjust it to the exact length that I want.  My other groomer that I replaced had a holder for everything which I'm able to use for this one so it would be nice if Remington would come with one.  Overall, great groomer and for the price imo, you can't do any better.  Fyi, get the blade oil because the blades stay sharper they don't get hot and I think the batteries last longer.  I put a drop or two on every other week."
7/31/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Good
7/31/2018	Amazon	1	Battery is worst!!	This trimmers battery didnt lasted for 3 months also. I am not able to use now as battery lasts for only couple of seconds. I should have purchased protection plan. I went and bought this trimmer by looking reviews and best seller tag.
7/31/2018	Amazon	3	but its better than nothing	does part of the job that i wanted it to do. but its better than nothing. battery life kinda sucks i had to keep it charged all day literally before i could gotten it to do its job without being plugged in. other than that its ok. could of been a better product but i get what i paid for so it will do for what it is.
7/31/2018	Amazon	5	Good buy	Everything works exactly how I'd like. No complaints here
7/31/2018	Amazon	5	#1 Shaver	Great shaver! I use it all the time. It's easy to use and clean. Great product. Would purchase again.
7/31/2018	Amazon	1	Broken after 4 uses	"This is a cheaply made product, in my opinion.  I purchased it a little under 4 months ago.  Ive used it a total of 4 times in those 4 months and today (on the 4th use) the attachment I use broke leaving a protruding sharp edge.  Dangerous!"
8/1/2018	Amazon	2	"Great product, but they break after a few months"	"For the price, it's an efficient trimmer that is easy to use on head, beard and body. I have to buy a new one every 4 to 6 months or so because they just stop working. Lol. Currently on my fourth one in two years. I figure an $80 trimmer would probably break on me in that amount of time anyway, so it's no less economical to toss these out and replace them. That said, I'm done with these. My fourth one just stopped turning on after 4 months and I think I'll try a different brand."
8/1/2018	Amazon	5	Easy way to control the beard.	Bought this as a fathers day gift for my husband.  He really likes it.
8/1/2018	Amazon	1	Dull blades.	I bought one of these before which worked perfectly. This one however is like the blades aren't sharpened and as a result leaves me looking like i haven't even tried to shave.
8/2/2018	Amazon	1	Very worthless	Do not buy dosen't even cut hair
8/2/2018	Amazon	5	Bargain	Great price. As advertised.
8/2/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	WORKS WELL
8/2/2018	Amazon	4	"So, I wasn't going to write a review but ..."	"**Update** Its now August 10, it was too good to be true. Alas this razor is not everlasting. Today was the day this razor finally died. It took 4 months, jeez Im so impressed  So, I wasn't going to write a review but had to after I used this product this morning. I dont understand what witchcraft Remington has used on this razor but it never dies. I've had it since the beginning of April and have only charged it one time! I use this thing about 3 to 4 times a week and it is still going strong. The razor itself is aight, i mean it gets the job done, nothing fancy. But jeez I dont understand how this thing is still running 3 months later off one charge!"
8/3/2018	Amazon	1	Broke after 7 months	"Piece of crap! This Remington broke already. My husband has had it since the end of December 2017 until now - August 1st. Seriously? This is not even a tool that he uses everyday and it broke after 7 months, even though he is careful with respect to using and storing his things. Junk...he replaced it with a Braun."
8/3/2018	Amazon	1	Battery doesnt hold a charge.	What a piece of junk!!!! Ive owned two of these and both times the battery quit on me before I even had it for a year!!! Dont buy this cheaply made garbage. You get what you pay for with this one!
8/3/2018	Amazon	1	Garbage	Biggest pile of Diarrhea ever. Worked once and charged it now it wont even turn on. Gonna call amazon in the morning when Im less heated.
8/3/2018	Amazon	1	Will not charge	Defective. Will not recharge after initial use.
8/4/2018	Amazon	5	Works great!	Exactly what I needed at the right price!
8/4/2018	Amazon	5	Great buy!!	Perfect!!!!
8/4/2018	Amazon	3	Adequate	It does the job decently.
8/5/2018	Amazon	4	I like this	I suffer from razor bumps when shaving but this is perfect it's like my own barber. I used it this morning and had a smooth cut. The clippers do get hot so I don't recommend leaving them on when during adjustments.
8/5/2018	Amazon	5	Nice	Works well!
8/5/2018	Amazon	1	Stopped working after 2 shaves	"I used this product twice, it was not intuitive or ergonomic. Then it died and I threw it away and went back to my old reliable clipper."
8/5/2018	Amazon	2	Disappointing.	"It says all in 1, but all it really does is trim hair.  It doesn't shave well. Doesn't trim ear or nose hairs well.  It just trims beard hears until they're a decent length for shaving."
8/5/2018	Amazon	4	3 years strong!	"Ive had this little shaver for about 3 years now. Nothing special, but gets the job done. I use it to keep a stuble, one recommendation, make sure you wash the blades after each shave. The power goes down a lot when the little hairs get stuck in between. For $20, I definitely got my moneys worth!"
8/7/2018	Amazon	1	Stopped working after 3 months	"Bought two of these items , both stopped working after three months!"
8/7/2018	Amazon	3	Works OK	"It's quiet which is nice. If you're using this for beard trimming - the guard attachment is pretty difficult to use. Most trimmers kind of click into place at the different levels, this one does not. e.g. - hard to tell if I'm trimming at a 6 or an 8. Nose trimmer works OK but it is flat so kind of difficult to hit some parts of the nostril."
8/7/2018	Amazon	5	4 years in and still going strong	"I have had this trimmer since 2014 and even though i have not been the best maintainer, this amazing tool has never once failed me. I have used it to trim my beard, shave my head, line up my face. Still pretty sharp. My wife uses it sometimes to shave her legs as well. This tool is small but quite powerful and effective. It hold a pretty decent charge . I honestly don't have any complaints whatsoever with this trimmer..."
8/7/2018	Amazon	2	You really have to press this in	"Two stars because it works. No more than that because my spouse really had to dig this into his face to trim his beard. It was hilarious for me to watch but not so much for him. Anyhow, we returned and order a corded trimmer since they seem to have more power than the cordless ones."
8/7/2018	Amazon	2	Doesn't last	After about a year the batter won't hold a charge for longer than 5 seconds
8/8/2018	Amazon	1	Bad design	The rectangular design of the nose trim made it very hard and not practical to use.
8/8/2018	Amazon	5	Que mas quieres por $10??	"Algo básico para todo el que usa barba. Los aditamentos son los justos, pero con maña y práctica salvan el día. Negativo: No se puede usar mientras se carga y la cuchillas de corte se pueden llegar a calentar mucho por fricción"
8/8/2018	Amazon	5	Excellent!	You will not be dissapointed!
8/8/2018	Amazon	4	Glad I bought it	Precise.  Works well for everything mentioned.
8/10/2018	Amazon	4	Good	Good
8/10/2018	Amazon	1	Battery failed after 90 days- won't charge at all now.	"Bought this just in mid April- it was working fine for the longest time, and now suddenly it won't recharge at all. There was no warning like degrading performance or anything- it's just done. Before- the battery would last nearly 2 weeks at a time and now it is done. Beyond the return policy. Will have to see if manufacturer will do anything about it."
8/11/2018	Amazon	1	1/2 star in my eyes....Died after 2-3 month use.	"Died after 2-3 months. I didn't read the 1 star  reviews, but wish I would have. No wonder it was $20. I dont recommend this."
8/11/2018	Amazon	5	Smooth  to Use	Sleek to handle cut is wonderful
8/11/2018	Amazon	1	"bad battery, won't hold motor speed."	"I've had this item less than a month, motor speed drops before I finish shaving, has a no return 3rd party seller, so Amazon won't take it back.  Not happy."
8/12/2018	Amazon	5	Price	Is easy
8/12/2018	Amazon	5	Works great	Only charged once. Holds charge forever.
8/12/2018	Amazon	5	good	"Love this guy! It's the perfect size for pretty much any use: body hair, facial hair, nose hair, armpits, even head hair to cut down or shave the sides and back, or even whole head."
8/12/2018	Amazon	5	Great product	Excellent
8/13/2018	Amazon	5	on time	works great
8/13/2018	Amazon	4	This was a gift and the recipient really likes the ...	This was a gift and the recipient really likes the shaver and the accessories that comes in the set. His previous shaver was also a Remington and it lasted for a very long time...hoping this one will too.
8/14/2018	Amazon	5	No pulling hair.	Perfect trimmer for bikini area. Loved it. Doesnt pull any hair.
8/14/2018	Amazon	5	Haircut	Great
8/14/2018	Amazon	5	Love it ??	Love it and long lasting battery.
8/14/2018	Amazon	2	Worked great for 9 months - then battery died.	"I really, really liked this product a lot better than the philips trimmer that it replaced.  It trimmed a lot better and didn't create as big of a mess (plus being able to rinse it off was a huge plus, compared to my previous trimmer which was not a wet/dry trimmer).  At first the battery life was a lot better too, but after 9 months it wouldn't recharge, making it useless."
8/14/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Love it!
8/15/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	My husband love love love. He likes that fact the tops twist off.
8/15/2018	Amazon	1	flawed battery	"This thing is complete junk. I bought one several months ago. It worked great for a while, then the battery failed. I thought maybe I had done something wrong, so like an idiot, I bought another one, being careful this time to use the correct charger and otherwise following instructions. I got about 3 weeks out of it before it died. If you're thinking of buying this garbage, good luck."
8/16/2018	Amazon	5	Great trimmer	Works great. Doesnt pull hair. Holds a charge. Easy to change attachments.
8/17/2018	Amazon	5	Hi	Very good thanks
8/17/2018	Amazon	5	The way it is made top-of-the-line old school	Great product great job
8/19/2018	Amazon	3	A great disposable electric shaver	"Its a good cheap electric shaver while it worked. After 8 months of use, the battery wont hold a charge anymore. But for 20$ i guess i got my moneys worth. Also if you forget to recharge it, you cant plug it in the wall and use it at the same time if the battery is completely dead."
8/19/2018	Amazon	4	Good but not reliable	Its a really good product but its not charging. I just bought it a month ago and only needed to charge it now but it doesnt charge so I cant use it. Also the return window closed 2 days ago..
8/19/2018	Amazon	4	said they liked it.	"Was a gift, said they liked it."
8/19/2018	Amazon	5	Great	Great quality
8/20/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great
8/20/2018	Amazon	4	"Good set, bargain priced"	"This Remington set replaced a similar Norelco that I really liked, but the connecting parts of the attachments wore out and wouldn't stay on tightly. The Remington has a better designed coupling and should last a longer time. The actual attachments from both companies are similar in design and function, and at Amazon's price, this was a bargain. It charges fairly quick and runs at high RPM."
8/20/2018	Amazon	1	I just threw this in the trash	You'd be better off going to a CVS and buying one off the shelf. Complete waste of money.
8/21/2018	Amazon	1	Bad product	after a couple months it did not work
8/21/2018	Amazon	5	Great product	This hair clipper works great and nice to have the cordless feature if needed!
8/21/2018	Amazon	1	Dead After One Use	Used this once and it died. It shows it's charging but won't turn on. I can't even return it.
8/21/2018	Amazon	1	No good after 3 months of use	"Just over 3 months of use, and the trimmer is very dull... almost useless to try and shave with. Very disappointing"
8/21/2018	Amazon	5	"Great product, works perfectly!"	"Great product, works perfectly!"
8/21/2018	Amazon	1	Below avg performance	Overheating in 5 minutes
8/21/2018	Amazon	3	Three Stars	Have to tap it to get it going.
8/22/2018	Amazon	3	Nice	Wish it was little larger. Battary run out quickly. Good for bears that's it
8/22/2018	Amazon	5	Comes with a nose and ear trimmers which are easy to use AND has a foil guard and then ...	"I have gone through so many of these trimmers as most men probably do.  I use it mostly to trim my chest, and with the shortest guard works perfectly.  Not too long, not too short.  Has an average battery life, somewhere around 1.7 hours of running time.  Comes with a nose and ear trimmers which are easy to use AND has a foil guard and then come with a travel bag to store everything in when not using.  Out of all the ones I have bought in my life, these rank one of the best.  The only thing is they dull out quick and its cheaper to buy the entire package again vs buying a blade which sometimes cost more, go figure."
8/22/2018	Amazon	3	Cheap but useful	The quality is very low but it works decently.
8/22/2018	Amazon	5	Awesome!	I absolutely love this product and an excellent price.
8/22/2018	Amazon	5	Amazing product!	Couldn't be happier with this buy. Makes my life so much easier. saves me so much time and for the price you can't go wrong.
8/23/2018	Amazon	1	"Worked once.  Seriously people, don't buy it."	"The trimmer worked once when I tested it out of the box.  I threw the box away, tried to use it a few days later.  Nothing.  Deadc.  Won't hold a charge at all.  It appears to charge based on the light coming on, but if I can get it to run, it runs for about half a second.  Defective."
8/23/2018	Amazon	1	Poor quality... Atachments don't actually work... NO RETURNS!!!!!	I've always liked remington products but this is the first one that sucks. Poor construction and performance. The attachments don't work. The attachment plate is cheap and the attachments don't stay on (or work)...NO RETURNS!! DON'T PURCHASE!!!!!
8/23/2018	Amazon	3	Difficult to clean	Based on the difficulty of cleaning this product and its mediocre build quality - I would not recommend. I suspect it wont be long before it breaks.
8/24/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Ordered for another person
8/25/2018	Amazon	2	Two Stars	"It's ok, the tray is nothing but plastic.??"
8/26/2018	Amazon	5	Best grooming kit ever purchased!	"Quality wise it is awesome, battery lasts a long time too."
8/26/2018	Amazon	3	Very small shaver	"Its very small. My husband wasnt too thrilled when we received it. I was expecting a full size shaver.  It works and does what its supposed to but for a man with a beard or for shaving his head, its more time consuming."
8/27/2018	Amazon	2	Listen to the Bad Battery Reviews!	This grooms fine but the battery is atrocious and after 2 years I'm having to buy a new one. It doesn't hold a charge at all and it doesn't work when it's plugged in. Buyer beware!
8/27/2018	Amazon	2	Battery does not last.	I've used it for a little while now and the only issue I'm finding is the battery seems to be dying already. Not holding a charge very long.
8/28/2018	Amazon	5	Surprised	VERY GOOD
8/28/2018	Amazon	3	"Average quality, doesn't have many settings"	You don't get the variation in settings that you'd wish from a groomer. The varying length attachment is clumsy and not very accurate. The foil shaver is definitely not a replacement for a full foil shaver. You get a few half-decent replacements for the price.
8/28/2018	Amazon	1	Not worth it	This thing didn't last even 3 uses.  The battery life when it was working was terrible and now it won't charge.  Spend a little more and get something that isn't total junk.  I should have known.
8/28/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	works amazing
8/28/2018	Amazon	5	Worth the money	"It works great, no dislikes"
8/28/2018	Amazon	1	"Terrible battery, would not recommend at all June 2018"	Its been 2 months since I purchased this and the battery has already crapped out. Wont hold a charge. Completely useless now.
8/28/2018	Amazon	5	Just a great product	Have had my set since December 2016 and I still use it.. even bought another set for my brother..
8/28/2018	Amazon	1	Great to use if you like not shaving.	Stopped working after 2-3 uses.
8/28/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Great product at a great price!
8/29/2018	Amazon	5	and its so great that its	my husband loves this! and its so great that its wireless
8/29/2018	Amazon	5	Great for personal use!	Love it!
8/29/2018	Amazon	2	Two Stars	Doesn't stay charged for long.
8/29/2018	Amazon	1	Don't waste your money!!	The shaver does not cut. I just don't understand .
8/29/2018	Amazon	1	Stopped working after 3 months	I bought two of these in April and one of it stopped working in 2-3 weeks back.  I don't know if Amazon will take returns. But I would not buy this again and will not recommend it to anyone.
8/30/2018	Amazon	5	Don't hesitate buying this	Does not disappoint. Love the build quality the quality of the blades and the attachments
8/31/2018	Amazon	5	Works like it should	It does what it says it does and hasn't broke yet.
8/31/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Very good for price. Battery works for more than 3 hrs
9/1/2018	Amazon	5	Convenient	Very convenient to have at home.
9/1/2018	Amazon	5	Works great and long lasting.	This is my second one.  I had my first for over 4 years.  With packing it in suitcases and airplanes Im surprised it lasted that long.
9/2/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	"Works great, gets the job done"
9/3/2018	Amazon	4	Good for price point	"Powerful sharp blades, the base is a cheap plastic but still nice to have, the attachments are nice and washable but the device is not. Great product for under $30"
9/3/2018	Amazon	1	??	The clippers feels duller then usual..like the item i used to get them at Walmart all the time..but these ones I ordered feels deffrent seem like theire barely cutting
9/4/2018	Amazon	1	Panasonic	I dont like it is not good for shaving
9/4/2018	Amazon	5	"Quality Product, worth the $"	Quality product! Works like a charm
9/4/2018	Amazon	1	Garbage	"This thing is garbage. The electric shaver attachment only cuts hair if you feed them into it one at a time. The precision groomer barely works, and the clippers are crap. Even if you just want a cheap groomer for a quick once-over before a meeting, and plan to throw it away afterward, you will be disappointed. Can't believe ANY company would put their name on this, especially one as established as Remington. The brand seems like it should be Ching Chi Sh*t Stick. I will be sticking with Braun."
9/4/2018	Amazon	1	doesn't work/will not hold a charge	This razor would never hold a charge. My son has only used it once because it will not hold power. Very disappointed and would not recommend. The Philips that i bought for my husband is a far better choice.
9/5/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	????
9/6/2018	Amazon	2	Not working	After six months it stopped working suddenly.
9/6/2018	Amazon	1	Stopped working	"I thought it was okay  but one day it just stopped working, I thought it was the battery so I connected it to the power and still nothing. Garbage!"
9/6/2018	Amazon	4	Needs more power	"Wish it was more powerful, but overall very good trimmer"
9/6/2018	Amazon	5	Nice one	I like it
9/7/2018	Amazon	5	Overall good	"This thing definitely gets the job done. No peices were missing, the battery life is decent, and the holding bag fits the trimmer and all other heads perfectly."
9/7/2018	Amazon	5	WOMEN. YES. (One year later...)	"I bought this almost exactly a year ago. I am a female, and I use it to trim my cooter hair down to a manageable fuzz before shaving.  Ladies. Why has no one told me about this? If you are considering getting an electric razor for down there, DO IT. I only paid $15 and it's still going strong. No more razor burn. No more fancy $30 razor blades. Cuts the time and effort of shaving down by more than half. What used to take me around thirty minutes, now only takes five or less.  I cannot recommend this enough."
9/7/2018	Amazon	5	Very nice	Works great
9/7/2018	Amazon	4	Works but poor quality	Cheap but works so thats the point! Wont last forever but for $20 cant beat it!
9/8/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Love it
9/8/2018	Amazon	1	Worst Clippers I've Ever Bought	"Got the clippers, and they worked fine for a few months. But after those first few months the battery started crapping out like crazy. I thought I had a defective set so I bought another of the exact same clippers. Few months in the battery started crapping out like last time. DO NOT BUY THESE CLIPPERS. They will crap out on you very quickly. I didn't even use mine all that much to justify the battery going bad that quickly. Don't throw away your $20."
9/8/2018	Amazon	5	Decent Trimmer	"September 3, 2018  I don't use this much but it still work perfectly and the price was pretty decent. I have read about the battery problems in other reviews, but have not experienced any of these problems yet.  Pros: The trimmer is pretty small and it cuts hear pretty well.  Cons: None Yet!"
9/9/2018	Amazon	1	Item Description is deceiving.	I purchased this thinking it was more of a clipper than a beard trimmer.  The cutting head on this isn't big enough to cut hair and is about half the size of a normal hair clipper.  I've tried to return the item but Amazon will not let you return it so stay clear of this product and find one that will let you return it if you need to.
9/10/2018	Amazon	3	Nice product	Not a bad product
9/10/2018	Amazon	1	Dont buy!!!	P.O.S Battery stopped charging after4 months
9/11/2018	Amazon	1	cheap build and feel.	very cheap build. would look around for something better. just didn't feel like taking it back coz i had thrown away the box already
9/11/2018	Amazon	3	Good	Not easy to clean heads but hood battery and works good..
9/11/2018	Amazon	5	Good shaver	I bought this primarily for my sideburns and my neck hair. I've used it twice and it has worked well. Comes with a handy bag.
9/12/2018	Amazon	5	Inexpensive but still great!	"Honestly, for the price you get a steal. Everything comes neatly packaged & it all feels sturdy, not cheaply made. Good clean shave!"
9/12/2018	Amazon	1	Terribleeee	Thing broke in a month. Garbage manufacturing
9/12/2018	Amazon	3	CHARGER MISSING	I bought this item back in February 2018 and it just stopped working about a week ago. It is 9/12/18 now. I did not receive any charger to recharge the unit shaver. Can someone tell me if it came with one?
9/12/2018	Amazon	5	Good product	Love these
9/13/2018	Amazon	5	Nice quality and easy to use	Nice and easy to use. Battery lasts a long time
9/14/2018	Amazon	3	adequate	cheaply made quality--but price = quality. spend the extra for something else IMO
9/14/2018	Amazon	4	Good trimmer	Been very sturdy so far. Easy to clean and oil. Good quality.
9/14/2018	Amazon	1	Horrible Battery Will Die	"The battery life is horrid and the razor doesn't work while plugged in, so if it dies when you've only shaven half your face - deal with it - because that is your new look for the next 6 hours of charging time."
9/14/2018	Amazon	5	Perfect all in one!	"If you have a beard that has detail, this is a must have! All the attachments work great. I have been very impressed with this little machine. Wish I had found it sooner. You won't be disappointed!"
9/14/2018	Amazon	5	Works well	I have a pretty light beard and don't use a razor at all anymore since buying this. Leaves me a bit stubbly which is fine.
9/15/2018	Amazon	5	Worth the price. Very nice	Love it
9/15/2018	Amazon	3	Doesn't Hold Up	"Love this product except.... crappy, cheap plastic that breaks easily is used on the main grooming piece.  This is the 2nd one in a row that has lasted less than six months. I don't expect a lifetime of use but believe that at least a year is reasonable."
9/16/2018	Amazon	5	Very pleased with the item	Very pleased with the item
9/16/2018	Amazon	5	BEAUTIFUL SHAVER!!	BEST I EVER HAD AND TON'S OF ACCESSORIES..
9/17/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	COMPACT AND PERFECT FOR GROOMING NEEDS
9/17/2018	Amazon	5	Great deal. Great product	Great product for all around grooming needs. Keeps charge for long periods of in between uses. Highly recommend for price and uses.
9/17/2018	Amazon	1	Its useless!!	I bought this product for nose triming and it doesn't work!!! Waste of time and effort...
9/18/2018	Amazon	5	Does the Job	Great for what we needed
9/18/2018	Amazon	1	"piece of garbage, breaks almost immediately. battery wont charge."	"broken after 6 months, wont recharge. save your money."
9/18/2018	Amazon	2	Doesnt work	"This product does not work. It charges, but it will not trim hair with any adapter on any setting.  Im disappointed because it had good reviews and a friend of mine loves the one they got."
9/18/2018	Amazon	4	Great Trimmer	"Great trimmer, provides a smooth and close cut and a lot of attachments that work really well. About a month after I bought it it stopped charging which was disappointing but I liked it so much I bought another. Now writing this a few months after the purchase, the new charger worked for both trimmers so now I have 2 working trimmers and they both still charge. Great product."
9/20/2018	Amazon	5	Received on time	Works as expected
9/20/2018	Amazon	1	Ok	Ok
9/20/2018	Amazon	4	works but not well for thick beard hair.	works but struggles with a beard as thick as mine.
9/21/2018	Amazon	4	Works nice - holds a good charge	"Have used for a few weeks now --- easy to use, works well.  The trimmer does a nice job and easy to clean.  The foil shaving top is just OK - could shave closer - but this is NOT a shaver, it is a trimmer.  So the shave foil works when there is little stubble.  Overall, very nice trimmer."
9/21/2018	Amazon	1	Very poor quality	"I have had this product for about 3 months now, with light use (1x per week) and it will no longer hold a charge for more than a day, and has lost it's shaving power. When new it had a fast powerful sound, now it's slower, weak, and struggles to provide a quality shave."
9/21/2018	Amazon	5	Good Buy!	Works great so far.  Even has a shaver function.  Great for a good price!
9/22/2018	Amazon	5	Great product	Bought this for my son and he had no complaints..
9/22/2018	Amazon	5	"Great Trimmer, great price!"	Own two of these bad boys. I use it on may face to have a close trim. Works better then some of the higher priced trimmers i own. Would recommend!
9/22/2018	Amazon	5	Charge holds for months!	"We purchased this item in February 2018.  My husband charged it upon receipt and he hasnt had to recharge it yet.  Its used weekly so hes impressed. Ive seen reviews complaining about charging issues, but hes had no problems at all."
9/22/2018	Amazon	4	Got as goft	Got as a gift.. hope it works as expected..
9/22/2018	Amazon	5	Good product...	"Good product, working well"
9/22/2018	Amazon	5	excellent	works beautifully and the attachments makes it even better
9/24/2018	Amazon	5	Great trimmer	Smooth quiet and cuts very nice. Use it for my beard. Guards are very short even the adjustable.
9/24/2018	Amazon	5	Best trimmer I used	"Sturdy build, perfect trim"
9/24/2018	Amazon	2	Poorly Made	Waste of money. Did not like.
9/25/2018	Amazon	5	Works great and long battery life.	I use this to trim my beard and it words great. It can get hot if you use it for a while. For the price i don't think you will find anything better. Highly recommended.
9/25/2018	Amazon	5	Works Great.	I am very satisfied with my purchase.
9/25/2018	Amazon	2	I need a thorough beard trimmer...	"...this device works pretty well for trimming around, under my beatd and leveling my sideburns, eyebrows but WILL NOT mow through my beard to keep it at a uniform length.  ALSO, the trimmer blades are extremely hard to clean/ remove the trimmed hair. When I disassembled the cutter/blades it fell into pieces... I'm real glad that I used my grooming tray to catch the parts or they may have been lost forever to city sewer system, much like watch repair: too many microscopic parts. My old Norelco electric hair trimmer has one assembly, remove, take my small firm bristled brush to remove cut beard. Then lightly oil and snap back in place.  I do a little manscaping around ""the bits"" but I can't use the ""Remington PG6025"", even with the brush guard attached it feels more like a weed eater than a comfortable, gentle trimmer for grooming. Good luck, ...be carefull."
9/26/2018	Amazon	5	A well body trimmer	Your battery lasts a lot! Good product.
9/26/2018	Amazon	5	Works great	Works great
9/26/2018	Amazon	1	small Cheap toy like razor	Very cheap razor did not trim my face very well all the attachments are like little toys in the stand is just a cheap piece of plastic all the parts fall off
9/27/2018	Amazon	2	Two Stars	not a close enough trim.  was looking for an edger.
9/28/2018	Amazon	2	Battery Life is Terrible	"Mine lasted me about 3 months before the battery went bad. It still would work but would literally die within 2 minutes even if I charged it all night, or even longer. When it worked it was a good trimmer and I'm sad to get rid of it. But it takes me longer than 2 minutes to trim my beard."
9/28/2018	Amazon	5	Good product	Still running strong over a year later.
9/28/2018	Amazon	5	Great product	Love it does exactly what its supposed to do keeps me clean and smooth
9/28/2018	Amazon	3	Razor kit came incomplete twice!	I like the razor kit but it was missing the foil attachment. I ordered another and it came missing the same attachment. Had to return both and I'm reluctant to order a third now.
9/29/2018	Amazon	1	"Garbage. Battery defect, won't charge after 3rd time :("	It doesn't charge anymore and only after the third charge. Cost me $18 to trim 3 times. Not worth it.
9/29/2018	Amazon	2	"Good, until the battery fails."	"I've had 2 of this model, and both suffered the same fate. I only use it every week or two to keep my beard a reasonable length, and was very impressed that the battery lasted about a year without needing to be charged! However, after fully recharging, it only runs for a minute or two total before dying and needing to be plugged in. As many others have pointed out, there is a serious flaw with the battery and for someone that uses it more than I do (15 seconds every 1-2 weeks) that could be a very annoying issue."
9/29/2018	Amazon	5	Best invention ever	I like everything about it.
9/29/2018	Amazon	5	Longer beard attachment than other brands.	"The ""hair"" attachment works great if you have a longer, more full beard. Zero issues with this trimmer."
9/29/2018	Amazon	5	Works great for the price	Trims very clean & the power seems great for the price. We will see how long it lasts.
9/30/2018	Amazon	5	Great buy.	Works great very pleased.
10/1/2018	Amazon	4	"I love their guns, but I never knew they made great grooming supplies"	"Remington is famed for their high quality firearms, and now thanks to them, I can get my excess nostril hair under control as well. Another straight shooter from Remington!"
10/1/2018	Amazon	1	Disposable due to battery.	"Used a few times and when the battery went out I wasnt able to recharge it.  That means, once you're out of battery, you're DONE !!!"
10/2/2018	Amazon	1	"Worst beard trimmer I have ever used, should be listed as a Epilator."	Everyone of the blades I use regardless of being oiled or new pulls the hair out of my face. Does not matter if the hair is long or short.
10/2/2018	Amazon	4	Pretty good trimmer	4/5 stars. Works well but the blade width could be wider and it could use an adjustable guard.
10/2/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Works great! love it!
10/2/2018	Amazon	4	Four Stars	Looks good
10/3/2018	Amazon	5	Great beard clippers	Great clippers. Good quality for the price.
10/3/2018	Amazon	5	Great quality	Very pleased. Happy camper now! Highly recommend them.
10/3/2018	Amazon	1	Died in 3 months of usage	Stopped working after 3 months of use. Doesnt turn on. Waste of money!!
10/4/2018	Amazon	1	stopped working	battery doesn't charge anymore
10/4/2018	Amazon	3	"Good trimmer, but the charging block stops working after awhile"	"I bought two of these trimmers and i thought the battery had died the first time as well like everybody else says, but i found out it was the charger because i bought another one and used the charger to charge both of them and a few weeks later that charger stopped working and i know its the charger cause i didnt use the new trimmer since the other trimmer worked well"
10/4/2018	Amazon	1	Not as good as I hoped.	It is extremely overrated and it takes up way to much space. I regret this purchase.
10/4/2018	Amazon	5	Long battery. Lots of attachments.	Works nice. Lots of attachments. Long battery life.
10/5/2018	Amazon	5	Great for its price	Great battery lasts for long time. Great product. Nice few features come with it
10/5/2018	Amazon	5	5 star review highly recommend	"I really like this trimmer. Holds a charge, trims nicely,  easy to hold."
10/6/2018	Amazon	5	Works good	Good little shaver
10/6/2018	Amazon	5	Great product	"Great product, works perfect! more that i was expected. Thanks"
10/6/2018	Amazon	5	Can cut down a forest	Does its job
10/6/2018	Amazon	2	Not what I was hoping for.....	"The whole reason why I bought this was for the small foil shaver, & it doesnt work at All. Im trying to cut the areas around my Mustache and beard, and its just not cutting anything."
10/6/2018	Amazon	5	Works as expected	"Liked mine so much, just ordered another for my son!"
10/6/2018	Amazon	3	Works more of less	"It's very hard to get the perfect 0 large shave, it takes time to reach all of the hairs. Go for it if you want a clean shave in 15 minutes."
10/6/2018	Amazon	1	Annoying! Dont buy!!	One star too many!! Bought this for my boyfriend and when he plugged it in to charge for the second time using it the thing wouldnt turn on. The green light was on but it wouldnt turn on. I thought this would be a great trimmer for him due to the vast amount of rave reviews but its complete garbage... which is exactly where it is now.
10/7/2018	Amazon	5	Does the job	Does the job
10/7/2018	Amazon	3	nice	nice
10/8/2018	Amazon	3	Not as good as razor at close cut	"Compared with razor, this trimmer doesn't cut/damage the skin, but with the sacrifice of less close cut especially around chin."
10/8/2018	Amazon	1	Won't last.	I used it once a week for 5 minutes. It stopped working after 6 months. The Norelco it replaced lasted 30 years.
10/9/2018	Amazon	5	Great	Lovely. Works great. No complaints
10/9/2018	Amazon	5	"FOR THIS PRICE , I AM GETTING A FEW FOR CHRISTMAS TOO..!!"	"THIS IS A MUST FOR ANY WELL GROOMED FELLA..!! 100% ENDORSED , VERY HAPPY WITH THIS ITEM..!!"
10/9/2018	Amazon	4	Good bday gift	He loved it. Great bday gift.
10/9/2018	Amazon	2	No power	No power.
10/9/2018	Amazon	4	"Good, not great"	"The beard trimmers are good for trimming body hair but not great for beard hair. However, the attachment meant to cut head hair works well for beard trimming. The only qualm I have is with the detail attachment for making edges which doesn't work well at all."
10/9/2018	Amazon	2	They miss the foil shaver!!!!	"Hello,i was waiting for this shaver for 2 weeks and i was waiting for the foil shaver,i bought 2 remington of the same and both havent the foil shaver,pliz remintong respond this comment"
10/10/2018	Amazon	5	Good quality	A gift
10/10/2018	Amazon	4	Razor and accessories work great!	Tray holder is flimsy and razor accessories do not include a brush to clean it with. Razor and accessories work great!
10/10/2018	Amazon	5	Good purchase.	"So glad I bought this. Far better than my other electric razor. Longer battery life, and the multiple accessories let me play with shaping my beard."
10/11/2018	Amazon	5	.	Good trimmer
10/11/2018	Amazon	2	Not bad	Works fine. The steel trimmer gets heated and might burn your skin.
10/12/2018	Amazon	1	Not recommended	"The construction of the device is very poor, it doesn't cut my coarse beard hair.  It is essentially useless."
10/12/2018	Amazon	1	Stopped working just a few days after the support window closed!	This worked great while it lasted. Unfortunately it is not working anymore and I appear to have no options. I can't return it. I can't contact customer support. I am stuck with a lemon.  Bad Amazon shopping experience. I will give more preference to buying from Costco in the future.
10/13/2018	Amazon	4	Very decent	"Great for my thick facial hair. With proper oiling, the blade stays sharp and does not pull the hair at all. Great for the price"
10/13/2018	Amazon	5	Perfect	Like
10/13/2018	Amazon	5	Great price for a good item	Great price for a good item
10/14/2018	Amazon	5	Excellent product	"This thing is exactly what I needed, cheap, good and it's lightweight. I highly recommend the product"
10/14/2018	Amazon	1	Terrible Battery Performance	The battery did not hold a charge after a month.  When the battery is dead you have to plug it in AND WAIT several hours before there is enough charge to use the trimmer.
10/14/2018	Amazon	1	Stopped working in five months	"Stopped working within five moths! I could no longer charge the device using the charger provided, and there seems to be no way for me to return the defective product via Amazon."
10/14/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Excellent powerful product.
10/14/2018	Amazon	5	Works great	Like that all the attachable accessories that came with it work
10/14/2018	Amazon	5	Should have bought 2	This machine performs fantastic for its price. Bought it a while now and functions as if I got it yesterday.
10/15/2018	Amazon	1	So bad!!! Buyer beware	Please don't buy!!! This stopped working and I am disappointed with this product. I had such high hopes
10/15/2018	Amazon	5	Cuts to the Chase.	"Great for the body. I've never had an issue with these, and I've had them for a while now. Might've cut myself not being careful, or misplaced the unit altogether, but that's more me than clipper. More often than not, it delivers the trim I want."
10/16/2018	Amazon	1	Died after a month	"Okay design, but it stopped working after a little more than a month."
10/16/2018	Amazon	5	Time saver	Does everything it says
10/17/2018	Amazon	5	Perfect for home use	"Perfect size for home use, plenty of attachments for the average male and his trimming needs."
10/17/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Love it
10/18/2018	Amazon	5	Great Shave	So far I have not had any problems with it. I really like the adjustable clippers and the close shave I get from it.
10/18/2018	Amazon	4	Good trimmer	"Regular attachment works well, but nose trimmer does not. Great batterys life"
10/18/2018	Amazon	1	Terrible Product; Can't be returned.	"I bought this shaver thinking that I could conveniently place the shaver on the stand and got it recharged. But no, the stand is not a recharging station; you need to plug and unplug the cord yourself, which I found it messy and inconvenient to do.  Worse than that, the attachments are problematic. The nostril trimmer is very poorly designed, it takes a long time to trim just a few strand of hair in the nostrils.  And the shaver head gets heated, you can feel the strong heat on your skin while shaving. It's not so hot that it burns your skin, but hot enough to make you uncomfortable.  Worst of all, this product can't be returned. You better beware.  I would not recommend getting this product at all."
10/18/2018	Amazon	2	Trimmer is fine. Charger is bad.	I have purchased 2 of these. The first and second one lasted about 6 months to a year and then the charger breaks. They are so cheap that it is only a couple more bucks for the shaver than the charger alone. I am buying a new shaver but not this one.
10/18/2018	Amazon	5	Works great	"I've not had it very long, but it works great.  Comes with a bag to keep all of the attachments in one place.  So far, I really like it."
10/18/2018	Amazon	1	Bought twice. Broke down within a month both the times	Suddenly stops working after using 3-4 times despite full charge.
10/21/2018	Amazon	5	Works great right out of box!!	This thing works perfect and cuts close.  I like keeping my beard at a certain length.  It did a great job of that and cuts close to keep that 5 o'clock shadow look everyday if you want.  Also have my wife trim up the line on the back of my neck.  Haven't tried the 2 attachments yet though.
10/21/2018	Amazon	2	weak trimmer	Its like a toy.  Did not like it
10/21/2018	Amazon	1	Wont last very long	"I bought it as a body grooming piece, but it scratches your skin. Good for face area but not anywhere else. Update the battery stopped charging. Lots of people seem to have this problem maybe the best option is to bay a warranty but still sucks."
10/22/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Perfect Christmas gift.
10/22/2018	Amazon	5	Great	"My husband loves this shaver, it doesnt cut his skin or leave shaving burns."
10/22/2018	Amazon	5	So far so good.	"I just got this and used for the first time.  It works as advertised.  I wish the nose/ear hair trimmer was the round type, but it works."
10/22/2018	Amazon	1	Ineffective and cannot be returned to Amazon	"Lots of great accessories, but the motor is the equivalent of one of those cheap battery-powered nose/ear trimmers - too slow and low-powered to be effective. It was only after I became frustrated and decided to return it that I learned this item is not eligible for returns. Too bad I missed that.  Revisited the item page and now see that statement, but have never noticed that on a product page in all the years Ive been using Prime. My mistake. Will pay closer attention now - last time I buy something that cannot be returned, even if it doesnt work. Glad I didnt spend any more than I did on it."
10/22/2018	Amazon	5	Thank you	Came in a good time and decent price.
10/22/2018	Amazon	3	Cheap for a reason.	"Underwhelming.  Works okay if you want something simple. Body and nose hair attachments are basically useless.  If you want something that'll last and be an all in one to get the job done,  spend a little more and get a quality groomer."
10/23/2018	Amazon	2	"looks great, just weak"	"Sorry, this would not shave my face.. Maybe if you have peach fuz but this will not cut a man's beard or stash. I sent it back ... looks great, just weak"
10/23/2018	Amazon	1	Trimmer Machine battery is Not Charging. Charger is not working in order to Charge the battery.	Trimmer Machine battery is Not Charging. Charger is not working in order to Charge the battery.
10/24/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars!	This works amazing! Each blade works how youd expect. I havent had any problems out of this. I recommend this!
10/24/2018	Amazon	4	Good trimmer	Powerful long lasting battery. Many trimming options. Cuts well.
10/24/2018	Amazon	5	Greta priced product	I love my groomer! Definitely worth the price.
10/25/2018	Amazon	5	Good deal	"Works great , great battery life"
10/25/2018	Amazon	5	Works Great	"I use to be strictly a Norelco man.  I got a Remington electric razor as a gift, and decided I'd give it a try.  My Norelco now lives in the bottom of a dresser drawer as a backup.  So when my Norelco trimmer broke it was easy for me to break the N habit and buy a Remington.  I have not been disappointed the Remington is a better trimmer also.  The attachments are easy to change, and they cut great."
10/25/2018	Amazon	1	Does not hold a charge	Item does not shave/hold a charge.  I am trying to return item and get a response that item is not returnable.  No wonder it is not returnable.  It doen't work.  I would have given 0 stars if I had the choice.
10/25/2018	Amazon	1	Misleading BS product	"Total misrepresentation imo, they don't show the cord that sticks out of the bottom cluttering up your sink counter space. The base is just cheap thin plastic. Why don't the show it with the damn cord poking out the a$$ end like it real is. Totally misleading and Judy not worth it to me. I am not even going to keep it, what a load of junk."
10/25/2018	Amazon	4	Quality Product	All the attachments you'll need and the battery life is superb.
10/26/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Fiance loves this as a beard trimmer!
10/26/2018	Amazon	5	LOVED IT	A gift to the husband and uses it regularly and it has worked for him perfect no issues
10/26/2018	Amazon	5	good price...holds a good charge	power of the razor...plenty of attachments for all your needs
10/26/2018	Amazon	5	Works as it should!	Nothing complicated or misleading about this product - it works well!
10/27/2018	Amazon	1	Bad Battery!	"I bought this trimmer in February; I use it about twice a month. So now after about twenty usages, the battery will no longer hold a charge. The last one I bought at WalMart lasted two years and I thought that was bad. I need a refund on this product!"
10/28/2018	Amazon	5	OK	"Very good, I like it."
10/28/2018	Amazon	2	Gets the job done but hot	She gets really hot after a bit of continued use.. Guard adjusts nicely n stays in place.
10/28/2018	Amazon	5	Works for everything.	This bad boy gets the job done (:
10/28/2018	Amazon	1	"Defective product, dont waste your money."	Two months after purchase the battery stopped holding a charge. Waste of money.
10/29/2018	Amazon	5	Great Product	Works Great
10/29/2018	Amazon	5	This is a deal!	Great price. Comes with some many different options for different things. Hubby can shave his face or buzz his hair.
10/29/2018	Amazon	5	Works well	Easy to use
10/29/2018	Amazon	1	"Low Quality, Not Durable"	"Just buyed 2 months ago and  now not working. Some defect in charging, charged for 4 hours and it worked only for 5 mins. Not durable at all."
10/30/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Exactly what I needed at a good price
10/30/2018	Amazon	5	Gets the job done	"Have been using it for more than a year now, still works perfectly fine. The charge lasts sometimes up to a month. Used for grooming beard. The adjustable comb is handy, as you wont have to remove and replace with different comb sizes every time."
10/30/2018	Amazon	5	Lots of useful attachments	Holds charge for a while. Great (and unexpected) add-ons. Good value and I'd recommend it.
10/30/2018	Amazon	5	Good	Very good
10/30/2018	Amazon	5	Buenísimo	Excelente
10/31/2018	Amazon	2	Not effective	The small trimmer doesn't work too well. I feel my other machines have worked better.
11/1/2018	Amazon	1	Stopped working after 1 month	"Not sure what happened, my previous one lasted me 4 years. It makes this loud noise and the teeth get stuck to the hair ( very painful). This one lasted a month and a half ??"
11/1/2018	Amazon	1	Broke after one use	Won't turn back on. I would not recommend.
11/1/2018	Amazon	5	Battery is kinda meh but works great	Battery dies kinda quick but works great
11/1/2018	Amazon	5	"Nice, Quiet, lots of cutting options."	Works great. Holds charge well. This is a replacement for an older model I dropped on the floor and bent the blades.
11/3/2018	Amazon	5	Awesome.	Great product. Well made. Boyfriend loves it.
11/4/2018	Amazon	5	Excellent	Just loved it! Since the first time I used it.
11/5/2018	Amazon	5	Good grooming tool	Love it
11/5/2018	Amazon	4	Trimmer	Great trimmer for weekend getaways or everyday
11/5/2018	Amazon	5	Great product!	"For less than the price of a haircut, you could have a veritable barbershop at home! When a manufacturer offers a 60-day money back guarantee in case the buyer is not satisfied with the product, it usually is a sign that said manufacturer is SURE that the buyer will be more than satisfied. And after trying out the product, Remington has a right to feel that way. Great product, great value, great results!"
11/5/2018	Amazon	4	almost a home run	"great razor, and accessories, but the holder is junk, it will not hold the different guide heads the moment you bump it, all the stuff just flies all over, I wish it was better made as the razor. otherwise a 5 star"
11/6/2018	Amazon	5	Fantastic Trimmer	Awesome quality trimmer and battery lasts a long time in between charges. Really great product.
11/6/2018	Amazon	5	Just what I wanted	I was impressed the how well it functions.... Great product for the price. I would recommend it!
11/6/2018	Amazon	5	PERFECT!	PERFECT!
11/6/2018	Amazon	2	Unsurprisingly bad - gut says it was a wasteful buy	If I knew how poorly they cut I would have invested in something better. Two stars because I kinda knew what I was paying for considering the price.
11/7/2018	Amazon	1	DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT PERIOD NOT EVEN 1 START	I bought this product 2 different occasions once from walmart and once from amazon and both times it felt miserable after little use . This product is really a scam both of those machines stop working after little Use !!!
11/7/2018	Amazon	1	pull my hair	"It  pull my Hair every time i use it, which it lead to shin."
11/7/2018	Amazon	4	Good quality for price	Battery doesnt last long
11/7/2018	Amazon	4	Works great. Not a huge fan of the adjustable head ...	"Works great. Not a huge fan of the adjustable head option, but I might just be spoiled by the function of my last one."
11/7/2018	Amazon	1	"""Charge stand""?  Really?  Is my hand a ""charge holder""?"	"Yea this is stupid.  The so called ""charge stand"" is just a plastic platform you can lay the thing on when you're not using it.  It does NOT charge squat.  You still have to plug in a separate obnoxious black cord which just lays messily on the counter.  And I don't know about you but when I'm naked and a bit wet the first thing I like to do is grab electrical cords.  Yea no.  Couple this nonsense with Amazon's no return policy on this turd and it's a huge mistake.  I will be very skeptical next time I consider a Remington product."
11/7/2018	Amazon	5	Excellent	Excellent
11/7/2018	Amazon	3	Three Stars	works pretty good wish it had a stand or case
11/7/2018	Amazon	5	Excellent	Excellent customer service and quality
11/8/2018	Amazon	5	A great buy	Very good buy plus an excellent machine.
11/8/2018	Amazon	5	Great	Great
11/9/2018	Amazon	5	My husband love it.	I ordered this for my husband and he love it.  He said it gives him a close shave.
11/9/2018	Amazon	5	Excellent razor for body and face	I had this same razor for about 8 years before it stopped working. I'm so glad I found the same exact one on amazon as a replacement! The new one is working perfectly so far.
11/9/2018	Amazon	4	Good so far.	I hope they self sharpen like was mentioned. I do like that they aren't loud and come with many tools.
11/10/2018	Amazon	4	Good shave	Very solid product for the price Works well on whole body
11/11/2018	Amazon	5	This works great. Would recommend to anyone.	Love this . Bought it to replace my old trmmer. Has a lot more attachments than my last one.
11/11/2018	Amazon	1	Ouch	"If you enjoy bloodletting, you'll enjoy this."
11/12/2018	Amazon	1	"Stopped working within 2 months of purchase, used only a handful of time"	"Worked well for a few weeks. Then went to use it and it was completely dead. Left on the charger and LED shows green as if it were charging, but power-on switch results in no action what so ever. Waste of $18"
11/12/2018	Amazon	1	buy another brand	"battery or motor went bas in less then six months, was good but should have lasted muck longer then it did..."
11/13/2018	Amazon	1	Cheap doesn't work good	Did not fully catch and trim my beard properly.
11/13/2018	Amazon	5	Great Product	Love that it came with multiple guards and its easy to change to the nose hair trimmer. Great buy for people with sensitive skin.
11/13/2018	Amazon	5	Great!	"Good battery, Good power, Cute & small in your hand. Perfect for trimming & shaving. I use it for travel."
11/13/2018	Amazon	5	"Works great, love the adjustable comb"	This shaver works great. I have used it a handful of times already and haven't charged it once. The adjustable comb is extremely convenient especially when shaving early in the morning before work.
11/14/2018	Amazon	1	Razor guard broke after a few uses!	I am not happy with this product.  The clear adjustable plastic razor guard is very fragile and broke when cleaning the razor.  The quality of this product is poor.  Don't waste your money.
11/14/2018	Amazon	1	Does not trim well	This trimmer is not good. Its trim is weak and does not reach the spots you need to trim. Was excited to buy it and not happy when I tried it out. Used it twice and went back to my 10 year old trimmer. Bummer.
11/14/2018	Amazon	5	Great	Its functional
11/14/2018	Amazon	5	Hardly ever have to charge	Manscaping power house
11/14/2018	Amazon	5	just delivered	DEliverwed
11/14/2018	Amazon	4	Excellent	Really good product I'm happy thank you very much
11/15/2018	Amazon	5	Works other places too	I didn't get this for facial hair.
11/15/2018	Amazon	5	good buy at this price	"This lightweight, (but not cheaply built) clipper does a great job of cutting and trimming tough beard hair. It's long lasting battery goes for weeks without charge and doesn't lose its power. Would buy again if needed."
11/15/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	Gets me shaved so yeah it works! Thanks Amazon And Jeff Bezos!!!!
11/16/2018	Amazon	5	As advertised	charge seems to last forever
11/16/2018	Amazon	5	Nice	Very durable
11/16/2018	Amazon	5	Very nice	"Husband very pleased except he needs a 3-blade, and only 2 and 4 are in this set."
11/17/2018	Amazon	5	Will buy it again	Will buy it again
11/17/2018	Amazon	1	Battery sucks	"Bought this for my husband to replace his older one (that he had for 4 years- same brand, older model). Worked great the first two months, then the battery life slowly got worse and worse. 6 months in and he has to break up his shaving to 2-3 sessions because he has to charge it in the middle of shaving. 1 hour of charging would give him about 5 minutes of shaving time. Writing this review because I'M SO TIRED OF SEEING HIS HALF SHAVEN FACE!!"
11/18/2018	Amazon	4	Good value for the money paid.	It is a good tool to keel your style running. Easy to manipulate.
11/18/2018	Amazon	1	Junk battery dies fast	More of a hassle to use and the shaving clips do not stay latched very good. Buy a quality shaver or prepare to buzz your hair.
11/18/2018	Amazon	4	Good for selective trims	"At first, this was a great product. Good battery life, worked well and didn't hurt my face. But as time went by, I wanted to be able to trim my beard at a longer length, and this trimmer only offers 3. Ended up buying a Braun beard trimmer that allows numerous lengths."
11/19/2018	Amazon	5	Works well to trim my moustache and sideburns	Very easy to handle and a good replacement for my old one that finally died on me
11/20/2018	Amazon	5	Cuts well and leaves defined lines	"From face to gooch, this versatile trimmer excels on all types of terrain."
11/20/2018	Amazon	5	Trim and tidy	My teenage boy has been shaving for 5 years and has wrecked multiple shavers and trimmers. I'm hoping this will help keep him trimmed and tidy.
11/21/2018	Amazon	1	No longer charges	6 months after purchase it no longer holds a charge.
11/21/2018	Amazon	5	Excellent quality!	Excellent quality!
11/21/2018	Amazon	5	"Good quality, nicely weighted"	"Worked right out of the box, feels like a well-made instrument that will last."
11/22/2018	Amazon	5	Great product	"Amazingly great, specially for the price"
11/22/2018	Amazon	1	Waste of money.	"Like other people said here, this battery is garbage.  It loses charge extremely fast and worst of all, you cant run it from the charger if the battery is dead.  You have to wait an extremely long time for the charge which again, lasts very little.  I regret this purchase."
11/22/2018	Amazon	1	Garbage	Will not hold a charge. Garbage
11/23/2018	Amazon	3	GOOD BUT...	The nose and ear trim is rectangular and does not work well...
11/23/2018	Amazon	1	Poor battery life	"Worked well initially but as other reviewers have noted, the battery life is terrible."
11/23/2018	Amazon	5	Fantastic	Highly recommend
11/24/2018	Amazon	5	Works wonderfully	"Great to use everyday, very sturdy too"
11/24/2018	Amazon	5	Nice Simple Set.	Dont leave Machine Charging More than 1/half hour.
11/25/2018	Amazon	5	Ok	Great gift ideas
11/25/2018	Amazon	5	A nice size	My husband loves the size. It's so easy to use & compact.
11/26/2018	Amazon	4	Great quality and battery life	It is a great package comes with everything in the picture. Works great and the battery lasts a long time. Bought as a gift for my husband and he loves it.
11/26/2018	Amazon	5	THEY DO REAL NEAT JOB.	Got these for my son. They do a great job on his beard .
11/27/2018	Amazon	5	Easy to use.	"East pay to use, stays charged for a long time.  I trim my beard every two weeks or so, after owning this for 6 weeks, I still have not needed to recharge it and it works great."
11/27/2018	Amazon	5	Loved it.	Bought this for my hubby. He really likes it. Good quality and durability. Buy with confidence.
11/27/2018	Amazon	4	Just ok	The plastic guides are cheep
11/27/2018	Amazon	5	Great Razor!	Great razor. Love the attachments. Would highly recommend
11/27/2018	Amazon	5	Great!!	My boyfriend loves this! Great quality for the cost and very easy to manage.
11/27/2018	Amazon	2	Battery lasted 7 months	"Purchased in April 2018.  I just tossed it due to the battery dying, looking for a replacement.  Worked great out of the box.  Slowly the blade started to cause skin irritation as it dulled; the blade was ""nicking"" me while trimming sideburns and goatee when I didn't want to use a razor.  About two months ago I noticed the battery not charging consistently.  I'd charge it overnight and occasionally it didn't seem to have full power when I used it after charging.  The charging problem persisted until a few days ago it just died completely - it wouldn't hold a charge nor would it even work with the charger plugged into the shaver.  A little disappointed it didn't last longer but for the price I guess you get what you pay for.  I'll try different shaver."
11/27/2018	Amazon	5	De Maravilla	Felicidades la máquina muy buena calidad y Precio
11/27/2018	Amazon	3	Great trimmer but plastic adjustable comb is fragile	Trimmer has worked great for years but what hurts is that the adjustable comb is fragile and breaks. That was the only piece I used out of the set and now the trimmer is useless to me and the replacement part is expensive for what it is. For $6 dollars more you can buy this whole set again so buying the replacement piece is just stupid at the price they ask.
11/28/2018	Amazon	4	Best regards to price	"Low noise, perfectly works, but needs some extra blades for zero shaving"
11/28/2018	Amazon	1	worthless	the battery wont hold charge and hence is underpowered so it does not cut well and rather can pull or grab hair. AVOID
11/28/2018	Amazon	1	Hair Grooming Kit	Shaver quit working after 3 months.
11/29/2018	Amazon	5	Worth it	Husband loves it
11/29/2018	Amazon	1	"VERY cheap materials, low RPM, tugs hair."	"Product is made out of very cheap materials, and is almost entirely made from cheap plastic. Although not expensive, for a similar price there are better options out there (search Braun or Phillips). The clipper head has a low RPM and can tug on hair, and all the optional attachment heads are made from the same cheap plastic. LAST STRAW: ITEM IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN. So if you are like me, and end up not liking the product, you wasted your money. I would not recommend this product to anyone given the alternatives on the market."
11/29/2018	Amazon	5	The correct model to  choose for your needs.	I chose this model with the comb attachment for areas other than facial hair because it is much more efficient.  I think it's a great product and it works very well!
11/29/2018	Amazon	5	Works as advertised	I bought this for closer detail work/trimming of my beard and it's been great for not only that but body hair as well. I haven't used all the attachments over the month or two that I've had it. The nose hair trimmer attachment is kind of hit or miss; I have a dedicated nose hair trimmer as well and that seems to work better. The charge lasts for a decent number of uses but you can also plug it into the wall and use it plugged in (after a brief delay if it's all out of battery) and that works fine as well.
11/29/2018	Amazon	4	Great little trimmer for toutch up work	"Decent little manscaping tool; just enough variety in attachments and long battery life.  Not as powerful as some past battery trimmers I've owned, but it works."
11/29/2018	Amazon	4	"Good, but the trimmer could have been a little bigger."	"A very good device once you connect the accessories. However, if you want a clean shaved skin, then this definitely gets too hot while charging. And since the main metal trimmer is a little small than expected, it takes a little while to complete a full trimming course."
11/29/2018	Amazon	5	on time delivery	great item. great delivery.
11/30/2018	Amazon	5	Well worth the money	Very durable and nice love the interchangeable heads got for my husband he loves it so far
11/30/2018	Amazon	5	WOULD RECOMMEND	I have always bought this product but i would buy the warranty as the chargers can break
11/30/2018	Amazon	1	Wasted of money	After only two month of use it not working. It's doesn't want to charge anymore. A completly wasted of money.
11/30/2018	Amazon	3	Okay	This product is toyish.
12/1/2018	Amazon	5	Awesome	My new favorite pair of clippers.
12/1/2018	Amazon	5	Great.	Great product. Thanks
12/1/2018	Amazon	5	Great!	Great
12/1/2018	Amazon	1	Cheap and useless.	"The gaurds are awful and jam easily, do not get."
12/2/2018	Amazon	5	Great and my husband loved it!	My husband loved it... what else can I say?
12/2/2018	Amazon	5	Great product	Great product Will buy again!!!
12/2/2018	Amazon	1	"Remington PG6025 needs a recall,will not re charge as advertised"	"Remington PG6025 needs a recall,will not re charge as advertised"
12/2/2018	Amazon	1	blade broke after it fell once...cheap build	it fell once and broke after a few weeks...the blade as you see in the pictures is very thin and fragile

12/3/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	works out great
12/3/2018	Amazon	5	Love it	Works awesome. Still havent had to recharge after 3 weeks
12/4/2018	Amazon	4	Good shaver	Decent trimmers. Would give it 5 stars but short shave attachment barely works since opening.
12/4/2018	Amazon	5	Good trimmer	"Works great, and holds a charge for a long time."
12/4/2018	Amazon	5	Works great lightweight	To be honest. I use this for my little dog. Works great
12/4/2018	Amazon	4	Good	Happy with purchased
12/5/2018	Amazon	5	Beard trimmer	Just as expected
12/5/2018	Amazon	5	Great Shaver! Recommend it!	All good!
12/5/2018	Amazon	5	Trimmed Goat	I love the head on these clippers.  Trims the hair perfectly and it is a lot easier then another brand I used and now use on my Golden Retriever.
12/5/2018	Amazon	4	Gentleman's must have	"Quick delivery, lightweight easy to use, nice interchangeable parts...easy to clean... Great value for the price..."
12/5/2018	Amazon	4	Looks just like the pic	"Came quickly, looks just like the pic. Was bought as a gift so I'm yet to know how well they work. Looks good!"
12/5/2018	Amazon	5	Great buy	Highly suggested
12/6/2018	Amazon	1	Foil shaver Missing	"Just open the box and saw that the foil shaver is missing, disappointed."
12/6/2018	Amazon	5	Really nice came super sharp very easy to use.	Really nice came super sharp very easy to use.
12/6/2018	Amazon	5	Amazing	Best trimmer I have bought so far for the price!
12/6/2018	Amazon	5	"works well, great price"	lots of attachments and works well. great price for the value
12/6/2018	Amazon	5	great!	works really well!
12/6/2018	Amazon	5	He loves it!	Everything needed for the man to do his thing. The other one broke and he didn't want to use the dogs corded one ; ) The fits the bill and works great. Has all the attachments he needs.
12/6/2018	Amazon	5	Nice	Works great
12/6/2018	Amazon	5	My husband loves it works well my son got the second he loves it to makes a great gift	Nothing it great fit works well
12/7/2018	Amazon	1	Not working	My product worked fine in the beginning but one month later it stopped working... can I get a replacement? Or a refund?
12/7/2018	Amazon	5	Exactly as advertised!	Excellent trimmer with many easy-to-remove depth combs.
12/7/2018	Amazon	5	Fantastic	My husband loves this. Multi tools for different uses. Cut his hair with ease.
12/7/2018	Amazon	5	Quick to ship	Amazing
12/7/2018	Amazon	5	Very good	Hubby still uses it loves it
12/7/2018	Amazon	5	Great	"Very good quality, works well, good price too."
12/7/2018	Amazon	5	husband loved	My husband used it right away yesterday when he got it. He loved it. He said its a great quality for the low price. I also bought my brother in law one for Christmas.
12/7/2018	Amazon	4	Reasonable	"Initial item was faulty, replacement seems to work correctly. Could use additional line testing for parts such as close trimmer ."
12/7/2018	Amazon	5	Decent for the money.	"Works good, nose hair trimmers not impressed.  Fast shipping good quality."
12/8/2018	Amazon	5	Gets the nose hairs too	This shave thing does everyman a favor.
12/8/2018	Amazon	1	Doesnt compete with other low end trimmers.	"I wish I had sent this back.  I lost the charger to my previous beard trimmer, a low end Panasonic and purchased this one thinking that all low end trimmers were created equal.  Needless to say I was wrong.  It pulls on the hairs of my beard, cuts like an actual razor when not using the guard, battery ok at best, and it also seems to clog easy.  In this case you get what you pay for."
12/8/2018	Amazon	5	Works Great! Great Price!	"Purchased this for my husband, and he loves it. Said it works great. Love the little storage bag it comes with to keep everything together! Defiantly good for travelers!"
12/8/2018	Amazon	4	GOOD TRAVEL COMPANION	This trimmer fits well when taking a trip. It comes in its own pouch and has several attachments that come in handy depending on the kind of look you're trying to achieve. It charges up well and last long. Its easy to use and does the job very well. This was an excellent purchase.
12/8/2018	Amazon	5	A+	"Great trimming guard options, very good at cutting. Battery lasts long and easy to clean"
12/8/2018	Amazon	5	Buy it	"I'm online buying another one of these for my husband. We purchased this exact model for $17 two years ago (2016) and he just text me today saying that it is no longer charging. This thing has been USED! I use it to trim my hair, my husband uses this solely to cut his hair, we both trim our noses (yes. lol) regularly with it. It has been awesome. It cuts well and -until now- has never had an issue with power or performance. We travel A LOT and it's small enough for him to throw into his toiletry kit and take wherever we go. So without hesitation I got back online and am ordering him another for this year's xmas gift. lol. Two years, thirteen countries, and countless uses for $17 - I'd clearly buy this thing again in a heartbeat."
12/9/2018	Amazon	4	Performs well for the price	It does work very well. My only complaint is sometimes it will pull my facial hair a little as it turns
12/9/2018	Amazon	5	Remington	As expected!
12/9/2018	Amazon	4	Good for face and chest.	Been using it 4 month's now and has been good for trimming my face and chest. Battery life is also good. Not sure if it's gonna make it to the 1 year mark without issues but we'll see.
12/9/2018	Amazon	5	Very Happy With It!	Very nice product. I'm happy with it and when I remember the price I like it even more. Buy it!
12/9/2018	Amazon	1	New PG 6025 Not Charging	"Delivered on time but impossible to charge the groomer, so of no use for anyone ... I am not the first here who encountered this problem with the PG 6025.."
12/10/2018	Amazon	5	Excellent	Excellent
12/10/2018	Amazon	4	Quick charging	"I ordered this for my boyfriend when his previous one died. It arrived on time and quickly charged,  would've like some more sturdy attachments but very much a great value for the price"
12/10/2018	Amazon	5	No need to go to the barber every week.	My boyfriend absolutely loves this. Best gift I've gotten him so far.
12/10/2018	Amazon	4	good product for the price	not a terrible product
12/10/2018	Amazon	5	Very satisfied	"I never used one of these before and although it took a bit of trial and error, I am very happy with this product. It's not loud, cuts very well. Would buy another one if needed."
12/10/2018	Amazon	4	Works as expected.	"I had their previous which the batter finally would no longer hold a charge. This model works good too, but I did like the stand my previous model had which allowed the unit to be charged when inserted."
12/10/2018	Amazon	3	Pretty Good Value	You really have to use a product like a beard trimmer.  This product was very reasonably priced and so far I have been happy with the results but that is only a couple of usages.  You really have to use the appliance for a while to know for sure.  Ask me again after I have used it for a couple of months at least.
12/10/2018	Amazon	5	Perfect gift item.	Perfect for traveling. Every thing you need in handy bag.  Well worth the price.
12/11/2018	Amazon	3	Economically Priced	Pretty noisy and the nose attachment is really too big.
12/11/2018	Amazon	1	Pass on this one.	"Worked great when I got it.  The initial charge was good enough to keep the groomer working until after the 30-day warranty was up.  The problem happened when I recharged it.  Followed the instructions yet the battery died after around a minute of use.  For all practical purposes, it's a piece of garbage."
12/11/2018	Amazon	5	Good product	Came as advertised.
12/11/2018	Amazon	5	Yes its cheap. But yes ITS STILL PERFECT!	Best razor on here. Dont buy anything else.
12/11/2018	Amazon	5	Beard	This works great for all those angles that are hard to line up. Its very affordable and works perfect
12/11/2018	Amazon	4	Hubby is looking good!	Easy to use and works great.
12/11/2018	Amazon	5	Good Trimming Shaver	"This is a good trimmer set with the accessories that are included. Just used it a few times but my main concern will be how long the lithium battery will hold a charge. Hopefully, for a few years, it will hold a charge."
12/12/2018	Amazon	5	"Arrived quickly, works well"	My husband has used it a couple of times now and really like it.
12/12/2018	Amazon	5	great	excellent
12/12/2018	Amazon	5	awesome purchase	"love this thing, i recommend it to friends and family all the time"
12/12/2018	Amazon	5	Long long battery life.	Comes with all the bells and whistles. Excellent product
12/13/2018	Amazon	2	Good for shaving but items not durable at all	Good shaver but the items came broken
12/13/2018	Amazon	5	The clipper set came everything was in it but I expected a brush and oil did not get it	I ordered the Remington all-in-one trimmer kit awesome working device
12/13/2018	Amazon	5	Great	Gift
12/13/2018	Amazon	4	Good value for a fine product	The various attachments make grooming easier. I like the rechargeable battery for the convenience and power. I've been able to cut down on my visits to the barber.
12/13/2018	Amazon	5	Worth the money	Very precise and works great!
12/13/2018	Amazon	5	EVALUACION DEL PRODUCTO	ME AGRADO LA CALIDAD Y EL FUNCIONAMIENTO DEL PRODUCTO
12/13/2018	Amazon	1	Stopped working after first charge!	"Item worked until i tried charging first time and never worked again. Maybe it's just a one time defective item,  but I'm going with a different model."
12/13/2018	Amazon	4	A great product with a low price	A fine product indeed....Best trimmer for the price. Come with a number of attachments..Holds a charge very well.
12/13/2018	Amazon	4	function	"userfriendly, Good to hold"
12/13/2018	Amazon	2	Not what I hoped for	"I bought this to trim my beard and keep it in shape (length and shape). Its just okay product. I thought the sliding length trimmer will be helpful to avoid different pieces (like my earlier philips model), but i am a little disappointed. The trimmed beard after many passes in not uniform. The plastic encasement does not give a good end result. Now I know I like the individual clip-on trim length model after using both styles. Honest opinion"
12/13/2018	Amazon	5	Nice	Its fine
12/13/2018	Amazon	5	Makes a great gift!	I got it for my boyfriend's birthday and he loves it!!!
12/14/2018	Amazon	4	works great	does a good job
12/14/2018	Amazon	5	Five Stars	great dad's gift
12/14/2018	Amazon	1	Battery failure	Battery failed after first recharge.  Won't buy Remington again.
12/14/2018	Amazon	1	Stopped working	Stopped working after 5 charges. Not Recommended.
12/14/2018	Amazon	5	Good quality	Liked my bfs so much I bought my own :)
12/14/2018	Amazon	1	I Do not ! reccomend this product!	This is the cheapest piece of s**t product I have ever bought on Amazon.  You get what you pay for I guess.. do yourself a favor and spend a little more..unless you want to keep getting it again and again..and again.  I'll never use this product again and highly Do Not! Reccomend it.  It's not made to last if that is what you're looking for.  Other than that.  It's a temporary pos.
12/15/2018	Amazon	4	it's ok	it was ok nothing super great but it does the job ok
12/15/2018	Amazon	4	Works great	I really like this item a lot. It's easy to use and the battery lasts a long time on one charge.
12/15/2018	Amazon	3	Ok product ....	It's a nice thing for that price
12/15/2018	Amazon	1	"This is false advertising.  The NOSE, EAR, and FULL SHAVER ATTACHMENTS  are useless !"	"The razor is very good quality for beard and mustache trimming.  But the attachments for nose, ear, and full shaver attachments do not attach to the unit.  They are useless."
12/16/2018	Amazon	5	??	Came on time and just as advertised
12/16/2018	Amazon	2	Flimsy structure	Accessories are bagged and require some fumbling to use.
12/16/2018	Amazon	3	Battery not good	"It's a fine cutter and runs quieter/smoother than my last trimmer. However, the battery does not last very long."
12/16/2018	Amazon	5	Groomer	"Loves it, use it several times a day. Couldn't live without this tool"
12/17/2018	Amazon	5	Must have with all the accessories	This kit is great. Cant beat the price.
12/17/2018	Amazon	1	"Quit Operating, dead, after 2 mos. Light on on switch, goes off when turn on."	Was using for trimming beard.
12/17/2018	Amazon	5	Very good.	Very versatil and good quality trimmer.
12/17/2018	Amazon	1	Its not worth it!!!	"Does not cut well, does not cut close to skin at all.  Not worth $1 to me now"
12/17/2018	Amazon	5	Great battery charge	The battery charge on this seems to last forever. I have been using it for several months now about once or twice a week and have only needed to charge it once. It works exactly as I needed it to
12/17/2018	Amazon	5	fast shipment	really fast and good quality
12/17/2018	Amazon	5	Well made	My husband says it's quiet and works well without pulling. Holds a charge for quite awhile and likes the pouch so that accessories are stored together.
12/18/2018	Amazon	5	Works great	Works great
12/18/2018	Amazon	1	Dead battery in less than 4 months.	The Remington PG6025 rechargeable battery has already died in less than 4 months of periodic use. I would use it maybe once a week and after just over 3 months I now have to keep it plugged in for it to work. If I unplug it when not in use and plug it in when I need it it does not work. Not happy that I have to plug it in 4 hours before I need it to charge a dead battery just so I can trim my face. Not happy with this product. Very cheaply made.
12/18/2018	Amazon	1	It's a POS	Garbage.  Worked for a month and died
12/18/2018	Amazon	5	Great!	This is a very good set. More bang for your buck too.
12/19/2018	Amazon	5	Excelente	Muy buen equipo
12/19/2018	Amazon	1	DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY	Stopped working after less than 2 months.
12/19/2018	Amazon	1	It stopped working after 2 1/2 months. Now it is worthless.	"This is the second beard trimmer I have purchased in 6 months. The first also stopped workling. I bought a different brand the second time, but it too is worthless. Very disappointing that a motor just grinds to a halt and quicks."
12/19/2018	Amazon	3	Not worth the money	Worked good for a while but everything started going out ! Big ol pos
12/19/2018	Amazon	5	Works great	Battery last a long time
12/19/2018	Amazon	5	nice product	Nice product
12/20/2018	Amazon	5	Great clippers	Excellent clipper set! Great batter life as well
12/20/2018	Amazon	5	Works great	This is the third shaver I bought as my sons love to steal mine.  Works great!
12/20/2018	Amazon	5	Nice	Nice
12/20/2018	Amazon	2	Not the quality I expected	Quality appears poor compared to the Wahl I previously used for many years. Switch and depth control attachment do not feel like they have the quality to last. I will update as I get more use.
12/20/2018	Amazon	5	Good Quality	"Fast delivery, good quality, 100% satisfied with this item."
12/21/2018	Amazon	4	Great product	Very versatile product.  It does everything I want it to do.
12/21/2018	Amazon	5	Well worth the price	"Have only had couple months, but this product works well w all trimming jobs... beard, head, brows, nose, and much more"
12/21/2018	Amazon	5	Christmas gifts	Gift for my son
12/21/2018	Amazon	2	Lasted just over a year.	Lasted just over a year.
12/22/2018	Amazon	5	Amazing buy	Works very well and battery last a long time
12/22/2018	Amazon	1	Garbage!!!	"Totally worthless, does not even cut hair"
12/22/2018	Amazon	5	Awesome	"My husband was very pleased with this product! I don't have much else to say but he loves it! So far, so good!"
12/23/2018	Amazon	2	A so so razor	One of the attachments broke when it fell into the sink. Reached out to customer service for help ordering a new attachment and they never replied to my messages.
12/23/2018	Amazon	5	Good shaving kit	Work well chargeable overall good product
12/23/2018	Amazon	5	Perfect!	This was a replacement for the same unit I've been using for the last couple of years. So no complaints here. ????????????????????
12/23/2018	Amazon	4	Does everything you need and more!	"This razor does everything you need it to do and way more. If you show this to anyone, they will think you are a barber. Many extensions connect to this product.  I think this product is excellent and you do not need to spend any more on a razor."
12/23/2018	Amazon	4	That this product was worth it	Good package
12/23/2018	Amazon	5	Great for traveling or even everyday use	Great for traveling or even everyday use
12/24/2018	Amazon	1	Does not clean shave...	It doesn't clean shave even with the smallest attachment. Battery life is good though....
12/24/2018	Amazon	5	Handy	Handy gadget
12/24/2018	Amazon	5	Great beard trimmer	"works great, battery holds good"
12/24/2018	Amazon	5	Works as intended.	Works great and feels comfortable. Has many options to choose length of your beard. Heads feel firm in place and easy to remove.
12/24/2018	Amazon	4	Beard Groomer	I like the three attachments shown on the second line. I have no clue what to use the three on the top line for
12/24/2018	Amazon	5	Not a complaint here!!!	"Got this as a gift for my fiance and he has no complaints. He's been shaved, trimmed and cleaned up ever since so I have no complaints in the world."
12/24/2018	Amazon	5	On time shipping	Love it works great and on time shipping
12/24/2018	Amazon	4	Everything i ever needed	"The Remington PG525 is a mans best friend when it come to grooming, has a bit for every are work really good only thing i had a problem with it is when its fully dead it cant be used while charging. PS be careful in sensitive areas"
12/25/2018	Amazon	5	Best trimmer ever!!	This is my second one.  My first one is still working.  I just broke the number one plastic attachment which I use all the time.  It was going to cost me around $3.00 to replace it so I just decided to buy a complete second shaver at $19.99 to have a spare in case the first one quit working.
12/25/2018	Amazon	1	Stopped Working!	"I like the trimmer, it worked just the way I had hoped. But only for 5 months and then it just died! It won't hold a charge and won't work even if plugged into a receptacle. Very disappointing. It has Remington's name on it so I had hoped that meant quality. I can't recommend a trimmer that only works less than half a year. Best to look for a better product."
12/25/2018	Amazon	5	Great	Works great
12/25/2018	Amazon	2	All or nothing..	"This product is not great for people that want to shave their head, but want to leave a buzz cut look. Its either you shave all your head completely bald,  or you leave A LOT of hair. The #1 and #2 adaptors leave a lot of hair. This product might be good for many people, but for my specific demographic, its not good at all. Ill keep this product to shave the back of my neck, however, thats all.. Ill need to buy another shaver that is more adaptable and leaves some hair when you shave without the adaptors on it. Looks like Ill go get the classic ConAir at Rite Aid again.."
12/25/2018	Amazon	2	Didnt last long	It only worked for a couple months and then the motor stopped working on me completely... was great when it worked
12/25/2018	Amazon	5	nice trimmer	cordless & works great
12/25/2018	Amazon	5	Best one yet and he has thick hair and lots of it!	"My friend raves about the fact that it is able to get through his thick hair with no problem and he has used it for a couple months now for his head, face and body hair."
12/25/2018	Amazon	4	Use	My beard
12/25/2018	Amazon	5	Great item for the price	My husband enjoyed this gift
12/26/2018	Amazon	5	He likes it. Big deal for a 15 year old	First shaver for my 15 year old nephew. Easy for him to use. Safe. Long battery life. Easy to clean.
12/26/2018	Amazon	5	Uniform trim	"Have had a beard I've kept closely trimmed for over 20 years, so I've used a LOT of trimmers.  This is the best trimmer I've ever owned.  It is quiet, powerful and (most importantly) give a very uniform trim.  Some trimmers require you going over a portion of your beard multiple times and in different directions to get what looks/feels like a uniform length, but this the most ""one and done"" trimmer I've ever owned.  My wife is already tired of me talking about it but she also agrees this is the best it's been!"
12/26/2018	Amazon	1	Failed After 9 Months	"Worked well while it lasted, but stopped working after 9 months of every-other-day use to keep my beard trimmed.  The battery won't charge.  The product only has a 3-month warranty, so I guess its going in the trash."
12/26/2018	Amazon	5	Very durable!	Great product!!! Husband gives it daily use!
12/26/2018	Amazon	5	Great deal	Works great
12/26/2018	Amazon	5	Fast shipping	Great product
12/26/2018	Amazon	5	Work's great!	"Love this.  I bought it for my dad for Christmas, and he loved it! It works so much better than other ones he's had and the clips don't just move on their own, they lock in so no room for error.  He's had a few others in the past but this one definitely sets the standard.  Great price for the product!"
12/26/2018	Amazon	5	Great fun book	"This is a great, fun book to share or place on the table! Enjoyed it greatly."
12/26/2018	Amazon	5	Works for facial hair	Good buy
12/26/2018	Amazon	2	Okay only as a trimmer - not for lots of hair	"This product does not replace actual hair clippers as it misses a lot of hair. I had to go back over my hair using my old clippers. This would probably be okay as a trimmer, but I suspect it would miss hairs doing it that way too."
12/27/2018	Amazon	1	Bad	Product worked for a month then died not a reliable groomer
12/27/2018	Amazon	5	My husband and son say it works well	Happy so far my son is haopy
12/27/2018	Amazon	5	Wonderful	Wonderful
12/27/2018	Amazon	3	Bueno	Recomendado
12/27/2018	Amazon	5	Good quality	Exactly what I wanted works great
12/27/2018	Amazon	5	Straight to the balls	Took care of the forest just fine
12/27/2018	Amazon	5	Works just as good as my last one	"Just replacing an item with a new one. Works just as good as my last one, just needed a new one."
12/27/2018	Amazon	5	Great trimmer	Small and easy to manover.
12/27/2018	Amazon	4	"For the price, excellent"	Lots of tools and attachments. Easy to use and clean. Holds battery life for a long time. The foil cutter doesnt work very well. Its hard to trim course hair with this.
12/28/2018	Amazon	5	Working perfect	Had a great quality
12/28/2018	Amazon	5	Great	Exactly what I was looking for
12/28/2018	Amazon	4	"FAST CHARGING, GREAT PRICE!!"	Very good quality.
12/28/2018	Amazon	5	Good quality	So good
12/28/2018	Amazon	2	Very poor battery	"Almost a year to the day, the battery failed.  Good little tool, with lots of attachments, but disappointed with the short batter life"
12/28/2018	Amazon	1	Would Not Recommend	"The lock on the back of the adjustable guard broke as I was using it. After the lock broke, the guard went from the largest size to the smallest, and took a huge chunk out of my beard. At that point, I had no point but to shave me beard off. I was super bummed.  It was probably the 10th time or so that I used the product. Strongly recommend purchasing another product."
12/28/2018	Amazon	4	Great buy	Durable and worth the money works well.
12/29/2018	Amazon	2	Poor battery life	"The first one I purchased lasted about 13 months-- not too bad. So, I bought the same unit in mid-October 2018. In mid-December 2018 the battery died (2 months). I contacted Remington and sent them a copy of the Amazon invoice and the serial number-- they are supposed to be sending me a replacement unit.  We'll see how long the replacement unit lasts."
12/29/2018	Amazon	5	Good for the cost	Love them
12/29/2018	Amazon	5	Sweet	Awesome. Very close shave with no attachments on. Love the handle and hold of the remington as well.
12/29/2018	Amazon	4	a good buy for the price.	a good buy
12/29/2018	Amazon	5	Convert your power if traveling abroad!	"Great clippers at a great price. This is my second set after using my first overseas with a power adapter, not converter... I now know the difference."
12/30/2018	Amazon	4	Cuts and shaves - but no Norelco	"I have been using this for quite some time as a back up shaver and when my other shaver is out of batt, or to travel. It does its job but its not a fancy $50 shaver. The other grooming accessories are great too and that was one of the reason I got this unit.  The only complaint is that it feels cheap and it takes a longer time to get the job done."
12/30/2018	Amazon	5	Great	Cuts great
12/30/2018	Amazon	3	Ok	Ok
12/30/2018	Amazon	5	Great clippers	"Great clippers, have no issues"
12/31/2018	Amazon	1	Stopped working	Stopped working after about a month. Dont buy.
12/31/2018	Amazon	1	Charger stops working	Charger stopped working after three months. Add $10 to the price for a replacement charger.
12/31/2018	Amazon	5	Great	Great!
12/31/2018	Amazon	5	Item came on time and as expected.	Item came on time and as expected.
1/1/2019	Amazon	2	"Questionable charging, battery life and durability."	"I bought this as a gift, but I heard some negative comments to share in this review.  Nowhere in the instructions that come with this trimmer does it explain about charging times for the battery. I found it odd that there's no explanation on how to charge the battery or even how someone would know when the charging is complete. It does have an indicator light, but it doesn't seem to go off when the battery is fully charged.  After a 4-hr charge, using the trimmer for about 1 minute you can hear the motor start to slow down. Within 4-5 minutes of total use, on a 4-hr charge, the battery is almost dead. A repeat with an 8-hr charge nets the same results. The battery must a low capacity battery or very poor. It's questionable whether the installed battery would even last for a duration of time. A trimmer should last longer than 4-5 minutes on a battery. Since there are no instructions you really don't know when the battery is fully charged.  I sent a message to the maker's tech support almost a week ago with questions about the charger and battery and thus far I have not received a response.  The trimmer seems to be below average in trimming and performance. The word I heard was ""mediocre."" It's disappointing this trimmer seems to be below par and not as described by the manufacturer."
1/1/2019	Amazon	5	Good little shaver	It shaves pretty well i like the 5 o clock shadow the on button acts up you just have to go on and off a few times but it does the job mine
1/1/2019	Amazon	5	Cheap and good	Good
1/1/2019	Amazon	5	Great gift	Great gift
1/1/2019	Amazon	3	Doesn't Provide a Close Shave	Purchased for my husband for Christmas. Doesn't shave as close as he would like but otherwise he was satisfied with the performance.
1/1/2019	Amazon	5	Do you have hair? You need this then...	"This is an awesome grooming electric shaver.  It can get all of your parts, including your beard.  In addition, you can clean it easily.  Don't hesitate, if you need to shave, groom your beard, or clean up some sensitive areas, this is a great product!"
1/1/2019	Amazon	5	Great product	Got this for xmas....love this product...does as advertised
1/1/2019	Amazon	5	Highly recommend!	"Bought this for my son, and it's great."
1/1/2019	Amazon	3	Limited but useful	"The grooming trimmer is very useful, but the foil shaver attachment does not deliver a good shave. The other attachments are very good, though."
1/1/2019	Amazon	1	Waste of money.	"Bought this August 24, 2018. Dead by January 1, 2019. Used once or twice a month to shave my legs. It just stopped working even after charging all night. It was a waste of money. When it did run, it ran a while per use. Never stopped during use. Just died one day."
1/1/2019	Amazon	5	Great product!	Awesome as advertised!
1/2/2019	Amazon	1	Worst	"Absolutely worst. This is my second time purchasing remington brand trimmer. First one stopped working after two months. Each time I plugged into charger, it showed charging. But after disconnect from the charger, the motor dont move . Same issue different model. I guess the price you pay, the quality you get."
1/2/2019	Amazon	5	Long battery	"Works really good, long battery. I use it about 3 times a week to keep my scruff neat, I haven't had to charge it once yet."
1/2/2019	Amazon	4	just what i needed	low price
1/2/2019	Amazon	4	Good for regular trimming	These trimmers work best for regular trimming and grooming. The multiple attachments provide a great versatility. I largely use the adjustable length attachment. It works very well to trim my beard and do some manscaping. It has so far provided a clean cut with no snagging. The only issue is the adjustable length attachment gets filled with hair as you trim. It doesn't appear to affect performance but it is a little annoying.
1/2/2019	Amazon	5	Very happy with it	Does the job very well as described
1/2/2019	Amazon	5	Does the job well!	Love it.
1/2/2019	Amazon	5	Just awesome!	Just awesome! ;)
1/2/2019	Amazon	5	Sssmmmooooooth	Perfect.  Fast delivery.  Smooooooth.
1/3/2019	Amazon	1	No power. Weak. Slow.	No power
1/3/2019	Amazon	4	Not always reliable	I have had this product for 5 months now and use it for about 20 minutes 2-4 times per month. For the past few weeks every time I pick it up to use it I have to switch it on and off multiple times before it finally stays on. I wash and dry the attachments but the body has never seen liquid so this must be a manufacturer defect.
1/3/2019	Amazon	5	Awesome shave	Great product
1/3/2019	Amazon	5	Great Price	This works awesome!
1/3/2019	Amazon	4	Head to toe does not include scalp	"Apparently head to toe does not include scalp, just an FYI.  The thing works well though but its not what I needed I got to trim other parts."
1/3/2019	Amazon	4	Very useful	Works really good. Cancelled by barber appointment and cut my hair with my wife's help. Except that I couldn't get that sharp shape up I wanted. Had to use razor blade
1/3/2019	Amazon	5	Perfect Product for Price	Works to my liking
1/3/2019	Amazon	5	Great product and customer service!	Great product and customer service!
1/3/2019	Amazon	5	Thumbs up	Great clipper. Small quiet and practical
1/4/2019	Amazon	1	save your money	Purchased this shaver and charged the battery on it when I first got it. The led light never changed colors it stayed orange. It worked Okay until the battery completely died. Now it has been plugged in for a week and it turns on and runs for about 10 seconds and dies.  It may just be my bad luck. I am going to try to find a better one though.
1/4/2019	Amazon	5	Good deal!	I bought this in November and have not charged it yet so very long battery life cuts smoothly. No complaints.
1/4/2019	Amazon	5	Good so far	Very easy to use although it has too many separate pieces.
1/4/2019	Amazon	1	Didnt last 3 months	"Ordered in October 2018, completely dead in December 2019... enough said"
1/4/2019	Amazon	5	easy handle and fix well	"I like it very much, it is easy to handle."
1/4/2019	Amazon	1	Faulty Battery	"Died out after a few days of use, unable to turn on after trying to charge it."
1/4/2019	Amazon	4	Grooming kit	I would give it 5 stars but everything falls off the base.Paid a few extra bucks just for the base
1/4/2019	Amazon	1	Buyer beware	Well it looked good but this thing sucks. The longer attachments really dont work well and hair gets stuck in it. Plus after 5 months the battery died. I seriously regret this purchase
1/4/2019	Amazon	5	Not Bad For The Price.	Good Product For The Price Range..
1/4/2019	Amazon	5	Great product.	Love it. Chordless. Battery lasts. Cuts very short.
1/4/2019	Amazon	1	Piece of Junk	Died 1 week after taking it out of the package.  Won't turn on at all!
1/5/2019	Amazon	5	Still using 2 years later!	I bought this 2 year's ago for Christmas. We use it for my husbands hair and beard atleast every 5 weeks. Works great!
1/5/2019	Amazon	2	Not bad.	Works okay but I'd go for a better brand that can be used wet and with a better battery.
1/5/2019	Amazon	4	Worth it	This a great product
1/6/2019	Amazon	5	Clippers	My husband loves these clippers. Great quality!
1/6/2019	Amazon	5	Trimmer	This product was a Christmas gift for my husband.
1/6/2019	Amazon	5	Great battery life	Great battery life
1/6/2019	Amazon	5	Great product	Great product! My husband loves every part of it.
1/6/2019	Amazon	5	Very pleased.	All in 1 is very convenient.
1/6/2019	Amazon	1	Poor cutting power	"Not really great for getting accurate trims on your beard. The blades don't cut very well either. The product notes that one can charge and use the trimmer at the same time but in reality that's not a real feature, the product will not work and charge at the same time if the battery is depleted."
1/6/2019	Amazon	4	Nice	Muy bueno y practico
1/6/2019	Amazon	3	"Remington PG6027 All-in-1 Lithium Powered Grooming Kit, Trimmer"	It doesn't cut sharp enough.
1/7/2019	Amazon	5	Trim Away!	This is my 3rd trimmer in 12yrs.  Remington is a good product.
1/7/2019	Amazon	5	A Darn Good Electric Razor	It trims my beard evenly and reliably. The clip on risers work like a charm and the battery life is decent.
1/7/2019	Amazon	2	Meh	"Does not cut close enough, it was a Christmas gift for my boyfriend and it just didnt stand up even closely to his 5 year old razor we were replacing."
1/7/2019	Amazon	5	Nice shaver	This is my second one bought one for my son who has a beard then went out a purchased one for me
1/7/2019	Amazon	5	I love the trimmer.	The product works as good as it should.
1/7/2019	Amazon	5	Good product	Its sharp and charge last long
1/7/2019	Amazon	5	Highly recommended	Husband loves this trimmer!
1/8/2019	Amazon	4	Really nice groomer	"Great power, closeness, accessories fit and finish, and overall ergonomics. This one pretty much does it all, and does so well. Holds a charge for a long time too."
1/8/2019	Amazon	5	They loved it	Bought as a gift. Many attachments.
1/8/2019	Amazon	5	Was a GIFT for someone ELSE	I DON'T KNOW
1/8/2019	Amazon	5	Ease of use	It is easy to use and does everything as it was described. Operates a long time between charges.
1/8/2019	Amazon	5	?	Nice portableshaver.  Long lasting rechargble battery.  Good selection of blade guards.
1/8/2019	Amazon	5	Works like stated!	Great product no issue with product.
1/8/2019	Amazon	5	Works Great	"Holds a very good charge, Trims well and has handy extensions. Does what it should for the price."
1/8/2019	Amazon	5	Very satisfied	Thank you
1/8/2019	Amazon	1	Could be fake Remington	Im not sure if this product is a true Remington device and it could be fake. The materials are different compared to my Remington I bought in Europe and the quality is much lower
1/8/2019	Amazon	4	Just what I Needed	"Arrived when it was supposed to, was exactly what I was hoping it would be. So far battery has lasted for two weeks of trims without recharging. The razor and nose trimmer attachments work great along with the rest.  Would buy again."
1/8/2019	Amazon	5	Great	Husband loves it
1/8/2019	Amazon	5	Love it!	Everything I was looking for
1/8/2019	Amazon	5	Great price for everyday groomer!	Husband loves it. Says it does everything he needs it to.
1/8/2019	Amazon	5	Muy buena!	Recomendado
1/8/2019	Amazon	5	Shaver	My girlfriend buzzed my head.
1/8/2019	Amazon	5	I did not have battery issue	"I bought mine 2 years ago.... Use it to shave head/face..... Was flawless and hardly ever needs charged..... I dropped mine though and damaged the blade, so I bought another..... I have not used it yet, but if it fails I will just put the new blade on my old model. For the money it is the best shave I have owned outside of a corded set of Wahl hair trimmers I bought years ago.... If I were to change something, I would make the blade area larger to make cutting hair faster."

1/9/2019	Amazon	1	broke immediatley	this product broke after 1 or 2 uses. I can't return because it's past the return time.  I don't recommend it.
1/9/2019	Amazon	4	Charges well	Husband loves the beard trimmer.
1/9/2019	Amazon	2	Worked well for 18 months	Worked well until it stopped after 18 months of use. It was working well and all of a sudden doesnt charge anymore
1/9/2019	Amazon	4	Very nice	Much quieter than the ones I replaced. Great charge on the lithium battery. Only wish there were additional longer guides available or included.
1/9/2019	Amazon	5	Awesome for the price	Works well and cuts your hair really short!
1/9/2019	Amazon	5	Good	As advertised Excellent
1/9/2019	Amazon	5	ty	ty
1/9/2019	Amazon	5	"Works, and does the job!"	I bought this for my husband and i really think he likes it. Everything has a nice bag to store it in  everything works great and has some really good attachments. For what you pay its a really good buy.
1/9/2019	Amazon	5	Love it.	Very compact and easy to store.
1/10/2019	Amazon	1	Does not work	"We fully charged it, it lit up green but does not work we turn it on and notta happens very disappointing and my husband is annoyed because I through his old clippers away"
1/10/2019	Amazon	2	Shaving kit	Didn't like the product
1/10/2019	Amazon	5	Fast Delivery	This works great and the LI battery should make it last for a while.
1/11/2019	Amazon	5	"If you will use it in EU or elsewhere outside 110v zone, you will need adapter."	Most wanted for travelers and whom liked to make a haircut by themselves or by kids;)
1/11/2019	Amazon	5	Worth every penny	Great timmer. Multiple attachments and the rechargeable battery to top it off.
1/11/2019	Amazon	4	Great tool	Everything I need
1/11/2019	Amazon	5	Good trimmer...many attachments	I use daily..holds a good charge....bought one for my travel kit also
1/11/2019	Amazon	5	awesome	works good
1/11/2019	Amazon	5	Great gift	Shipping was quick item as described. The men in my house look FABULOUS ??
1/11/2019	Amazon	4	Good home clipper set.	Good home clipper set.
1/12/2019	Amazon	4	Nice clipper set	So far so good. It's a quality made clipper set. I like the size for cleaning up the edges and touch ups between haircuts. Seems to hold a good charge. Some of the attachments are more useful than others.
1/12/2019	Amazon	1	Keep looking.	Buy something else. Battery didnt last a year. Now the only way to use it is plugged in.
1/12/2019	Amazon	5	Best purchase	Great buy. Especially for someone who needs to shave or trim on the go
1/12/2019	Amazon	5	Remington All in 1 hair Groomer	I bought this to replace my older Remington Groomer as the battery would not hold a charge. The replacement uses the old attachments as well as the new improved ones. All in all a great buy!
1/12/2019	Amazon	5	Shaves nice	"This thing is amazing for the price. Shaves nice and easy to switch heads,"
1/12/2019	Amazon	5	Excelente	Excelente
1/12/2019	Amazon	5	Excelente	Súper bien
1/12/2019	Amazon	2	Máquina de cortar pelo	"Es como la esperaba muy compacta y maniobra le, el cargador se quemó en la primer carga"
1/12/2019	Amazon	5	I definitely recommend this trimmer!	"I purchased this for my fiancé, as a Christmas gift, and he loved it. He was apprehensive about the brand Remington, and almost wanted me to send it back. But after trying he, he couldn't be happier."
1/12/2019	Amazon	5	Works very well	"This is a great product.  Light weight with different tools, stays charged a very long time."
1/12/2019	Amazon	5	"Works great on ""the boys"""	"At first I was scared I might cut my balls when using the trimmer, but I attached the plastic piece where you adjust the setting, and did the lowest setting: let me tell you... CLEAN trim! Almost clean shaven-like. Great purchase for an affordable price."

1/13/2019	Amazon	5	Great on my beard	Bought to trimmup beard and has plenty of power and easy to change heads
1/13/2019	Amazon	5	Great trimmer	Easy to use and cuts great! Perfect for beard and head
1/13/2019	Amazon	5	Effective	Covers all my trimming needs.
1/13/2019	Amazon	1	It didnt work! Such a disappointment!	"I hated purchasing this item. I bought it as a Christmas gift for my husband and now when he opens it to you in the new year it, it didnt work. What a disappointment!"
1/13/2019	Amazon	4	Un pequeño gran electrodoméstico	"Todo muy rápido y muy bien, pero mucho más pequeño de lo esperado, simplemente lleva más tiempo arreglarse la barba, pero funciona bien"
1/13/2019	Amazon	5	Great attachments	My husband loves this & uses it every day !
1/13/2019	Amazon	5	"Boyfriend says, ""it's good"""	And to get a flat out answer from him is a good thing. So this does as it's supposed to.
1/13/2019	Amazon	5	Good	Useful
1/14/2019	Amazon	1	Piece of junk	"I received this product and at a first glance I saw that it was covered in someone else's hair on the outside of the package. (Red flag number one) I open to find that a majority of the razor clips were missing and what's left of the clips were torn open out of there packages and just thrown in the box. This thing is a complete piece of junk. If you want a good beard trimmer get the Phillips one that is five bucks cheaper, that one works great with a ton of trimmer options. This one is completely worthless"
1/14/2019	Amazon	5	The Remington PG6025 grooming kit is a real time and money saver.	"I bought this to trim my beard and moustache. It recharges very quickly, holds a charge for a long time and is also very convenient. For the price it can't be beat. It comes with all of the necessary attachments in this kit. It's small size makes trimming a breeze."
1/14/2019	Amazon	5	Great	Great product
1/14/2019	Amazon	5	Great realiable durable product	"This was a replacement,  we like this product so buying again"
1/14/2019	Amazon	5	Good affordable trimmer	Good affordable trimmer
1/14/2019	Amazon	1	It didnt come anywhere near satisfactory for me.	It didnt come anywhere near satisfactory for me.
1/14/2019	Amazon	4	Works well	Husband uses
1/14/2019	Amazon	1	Stopped working after 2 months	"I bought this machine back in November based on the overwhelming positive reviews and reasonable price. However, after 2 months it stopped though I use it lightly to trim my beard once a week. When I checked the return policy, it doesnt allow customers to return the product after 60 days. This is third machine that I buy. It works for couple of months then stops suddenly."
1/14/2019	Amazon	3	Over rated	I like the accessories they are sturdy The machine does not cut as emphasized on the ratings.
1/14/2019	Amazon	4	Good shaver	I bought this Remington PG6025 to replace an older Remington shaver that I used several times a week to shave my head. The blades on this unit were so dull that I had to go back and forth to get a decent shave (not even a good one). I contacted Remington and they shipped me a new attachment for the shaver. Problem solved.
1/15/2019	Amazon	5	Nice package of grooming trimmers	"The kit arrived in a timely manner, well packaged and easy to see how everything works. The instructions recommend charging the battery for several hours which I did. I've only used a couple of the trimmer heads but they work as stated and don't pull hair or cut skin. I expect different people may have different experiences with this product but for my needs it's perfect. If by chance you're not satisfied the manufacturer has a 30-day return policy which is pretty liberal."
1/15/2019	Amazon	3	"Good razor, but holder is cheap and the foil head is small"	"This does the main purpose I purchased it for so in that it was a good buy at a good price.  The holder is cheap and doesn't do a very good job of keeping things tidy as the heads just sit in shallow holes and are prone to toppling over.  I ended up tossing the holder and putting the attachments in a small plastic basket, which saved space in my bathroom closet compared to the holder with a big footprint.  The foil head is very small.  It is good for tight places or cleaning up just the edges, but not a replacement for an electric shaver."
1/15/2019	Amazon	5	No scratching	Perfect for clean up. My son complained about other shavers scratching him. This one gets a nice close shave without scratching him.
1/15/2019	Amazon	4	Reliable and close cut	????

1/18/2019	Amazon	5	Good buy	Good buy and works great for hubby.
1/18/2019	Amazon	5	Great product	Works great and love the attachment options for addressing all of my beard and other hair grooming needs.
1/18/2019	Amazon	5	Great Value	The razor was a gift for my Husband and he enjoys using it. Very easy to use and comfortable. A lot of accessories to choose from.
1/18/2019	Amazon	5	Solidly made	"They work great, battery lasts a couple weeks of daily use, comes with different sized blade stops for different length hair.  I threw away what I didn't need and just used the one size.  Charging light tells your state of charge so there's no running out of juice in the middle of a shave."
1/18/2019	Amazon	5	Great trimmer	This thing works very well and the battery lasts a super long time. I use it once every two days to take my beard hair down to the stubble look and I've only charged it once this month. Its also great for...more private grooming if you know what I mean :-)
1/18/2019	Amazon	5	Product great for price	"For the price, product is great. But it's so small that it takes a while when using the foil"
1/18/2019	Amazon	5	????	????
1/19/2019	Amazon	1	Lasted 8 Months	The adjustable comb for beard trimming is made of cheap plastic and the adjustment tends to slip while trimming if any pressure at all is applied. This morning the plastic adjustment button broke making the shaver useless. I expected better from Remington.
1/19/2019	Amazon	1	Bad	I wouldn't consider it to anyone
1/19/2019	Amazon	4	Am happy with product.	Got this for my Grandson and he is very happy with it.  I would recommend this product to anyone.
1/19/2019	Amazon	5	Love	My husband Loves it !!
1/19/2019	Amazon	2	I m not happy..	On & off button. Is some time works sometimes no work... I order again
1/19/2019	Amazon	1	Lesson learned.	"Not impressed at all by this trimmer. The old Panasonic  that I bought this to replace was a lot better. This one feels flimsy, is slow, and does not trim nearly as close as I was expecting it to.  I was past my return window, so I threw it in the trash and bought a more expensive Whal, which I have been very pleased with.  I tried to go cheap and it didnt work out, lesson learned."
1/19/2019	Amazon	5	Excellent trimer	Exactly as listed.  All attachments work and makes self grooming so much easier
1/19/2019	Amazon	4	Yes I would recommend this kit	", good value simple to use"
1/19/2019	Amazon	5	Must Buy	One of the better (on the cheap side) trimmers Ive owned. Charges fast and performs great. Nice and even.
1/20/2019	Amazon	1	Stopped working in a month	Worked well for the month. It stopped working in a month. It would not charge at all.
1/20/2019	Amazon	5	affordable smaller razors	Well equipped with attachments-easy to get a good shave as close(or not so close) shave as you want-retains charge a long time
1/20/2019	Amazon	5	Works great!	This is a great little trimmer to have. The only negative I've noticed is while using the adjustable blade cover it does not lock in place on the setting you choose. If you end up pushing against your skin too hard the desired length may change.
1/20/2019	Amazon	5	Was hesitant to replace my old Norelco...	"I was hesitant to replace my old Norelco. I new the settings i preferred using for my beard and for my hair. But...it wouldn't hold a charge any more. For whatever reason, my Norelco would not charge and operate at the same time. This new Remington is great. Many different settings to get my beard just right. Holds a charge ""forever"". Very well made too. Only comment....to change the head, you have to twist for it to come off, which is not intuitive and owner's manual does not explain either."
1/20/2019	Amazon	5	Happy with purchase	Got what I ordered and met my expectations of a quality product
1/21/2019	Amazon	5	Llo recomiendo que lo comprrn	"Me gusto mucho, es biena calidad gracias"
1/21/2019	Amazon	5	Love it!	Great trimmer at a great cost!
1/21/2019	Amazon	5	"Reliable, close shave"	"I love this trimmer! Comes with all these great accessories. Works flawlessly, I have no issues with it."
1/21/2019	Amazon	4	He loves it it fits him so good	The clippers cut my husband hair with a clean  cut  he loves it
1/21/2019	Amazon	5	5 stars	5 stars
1/21/2019	Amazon	5	Love it	Great value works great no issues
1/22/2019	Amazon	1	Should be advertised as disposable	Common problem with cheap razors like this is they work maybe a handful of times then they go to crap
1/22/2019	Amazon	4	DISAPPOINTED	"I had this trimmer for less than 3 months. I don't have a very heavy beard and the piece I use the most already broke. I enjoyed it while it worked but 3 1/2 months doesn't make for a great product. *After locating the phone number and speaking to a customer service rep, I received a replacement part free of charge. I must say, I needed to call twice as the first rep insisted on a serial number that I wasnt privy to since at the time if my call. When I called back the second time, the customer service rep didnt even ask for the serial number. Long and short, it all worked out and I think the trimmer is great!!"
1/22/2019	Amazon	5	A Christmas gift	"My dad loves this razor, it was a Christmas gift for him."
1/22/2019	Amazon	5	Good	Good
1/22/2019	Amazon	1	very bad battery	battery very bad
1/22/2019	Amazon	5	awesome	I love it. Would recommend.
1/22/2019	Amazon	1	Return process sucks	"The nose clippers part sucks and you cant do a normal return.  And you have to ship it to Remington, And pay for postage."
1/22/2019	Amazon	5	Solid trimmer	Versatile and great battery. gets the job done
1/23/2019	Amazon	5	Good deal	Works great
1/23/2019	Amazon	5	Great value	Lost the charger for my current unit and discovered replacing it would cost almost as much as a complete new trimmer set. So I ordered a new set and share the charger.
1/23/2019	Amazon	5	Affordable and durable	Love it
1/23/2019	Amazon	4	Pretty good	Pretty good not the best
1/23/2019	Amazon	5	Very nice	"Brought this for husband for a Christmas gift he loves it,it does the job!"
1/23/2019	Amazon	5	Trims	Works great for trimming hair.
1/23/2019	Amazon	1	Never worked	Got this and plugged it in in for 24 hours.  It never turned on no matter what I did.
1/23/2019	Amazon	4	Great quality	"So so good, better then expected"
1/24/2019	Amazon	5	A1	Awsome
1/24/2019	Amazon	1	Terrible! Terrible!	Completely died after 1st use.
1/24/2019	Amazon	5	hair trim	be on notice my hair is all gone
1/24/2019	Amazon	1	Battery	Battery life is terrible no power at all.
1/24/2019	Amazon	5	Best for sensitive	I have extremely sensitive skin so shaving is out of the question- this gives me the closest thing to a shave without the irritation. Works so well this is my second time buying this model. Only replacing it because I wanted a second to travel with as my original one is still going strong.
1/24/2019	Amazon	5	Love it!!!	Bought for my boyfriend and he loves it! The guards work great!! Nice even shave
1/24/2019	Amazon	5	Size is perfect	I use it for my fine hair. Works perfect because i love to keep it short. Love that comes in a small black bag.
1/24/2019	Amazon	5	My sexy man	We love it! He loves it! It was a perfect gift at the perfect time!
1/24/2019	Amazon	4	Nice	Bought this for my husband and he likes it.
1/25/2019	Amazon	5	Doesn't pull	I'm actually surprised it hasn't pulled yet.
1/25/2019	Amazon	5	Great Razor	Battery lasts forever and all the attachments are nice.
1/25/2019	Amazon	3	Decent trimmer - most attachments are useless	"Bare blade trimmer is decent, body hair and adjustable length trimmer attachments don't work at all, they just push hair down. Nose trimmer is nice, foil is nice. Motor seems a bit slow/weak but no troubles so far."
1/25/2019	Amazon	5	It works for female also!	I use this to trim the hair off my groin area because razors hurt my skin and well Brazilian waxes can be expensive. This trimmer gets very close to the skin which I love and best of all it's PAINLESS! There's no tugging or pulling on the hair. Very happy I went with this choice. Highly recommend it. Also the first time I ordered this it was delivered to the wrong address and they quickly sent me a new one. LOVE IT!

1/26/2019	Amazon	5	Long lasting well built	Exactly what I expected
1/26/2019	Amazon	1	It gets too hot and it nearly burns skin!	This machine is good but it gets very hot in n the cutting head and itll burn your skind if it touched your skin!
1/26/2019	Amazon	5	"Great quality, good value"	"My husband loves this set. Great quality, reasonable price."
1/26/2019	Amazon	5	As advertised	Perfect for in between hair cuts
1/26/2019	Amazon	3	So so product.	Happy with it but didnt come with all the accessories pictured
1/26/2019	Amazon	5	Great buy!!!	"I gave to my son for Christmas,he loves this set!"
1/26/2019	Amazon	5	Works great for my purposes!	"This was perfect for my purpose.  I like to keep the hair on my balding head closely trimmed to my scalp, so every couple of days I run it (with the appropriate attachment) over my scalp, and it works perfectly. I always look at it by just leftnthe barbershop. I figured that I say somewhere between four and $500 per year and BOB i I figured that I say somewhere between $400 and $500 per year in barber s fees.  I like to keep a stubble on my face and I can do it very easily. Its not great at getting a hair-free facial shave, but thats not what Im looking for."
1/27/2019	Amazon	3	Will not work	When they came worked great after a month they want even turn on.
1/27/2019	Amazon	5	Awesome trimmer	Use this weekly to shave head. Holds charge great. Easy to use. Plenty of guides
1/27/2019	Amazon	5	Close shave!	"Great product, great brand name."
1/27/2019	Amazon	2	Full-size trimmer broken after 1 month of use	"Overall the kit provides all necessary tools for me, but its durability seems questionable. After a little bit over a month of use, the trimmer started to make noise and broke immediately after. It's the most important piece in this kit, and now I can not use the trimmer or any of the combs. The shaver also caught my beard a couple times too."
1/27/2019	Amazon	1	Disappointing	Good review was too early. Battery has run out and shaver not charging. Shaver was bought in December and now totally useless as it doesnt charge
1/28/2019	Amazon	5	"Buzzzzz, buzzzz"	"This was a replacement for another Remington that I had for years but the motor would no longer take a charge or the charger itself had failed.  But, this unit does everything I expected and wanted it to do.  Good unit and product."
1/28/2019	Amazon	5	Gift	"Christmas gift, son says he really likes it"
1/28/2019	Amazon	2	Not Quite the way I expected	"1. The combs are not as good as their earlier model for very short trimming. 2. Once the battery is drained, it stop even if plugged. So you could be in the middle of trimming and can do nothing until it charges again. I asked but never received info on this. I would not have bought."
1/28/2019	Amazon	5	My son loves this trimmer	It's come in handy and easy for a teen to groom. Great buy!
1/28/2019	Amazon	1	"Poor performance, can not recommend."	Very poor performance for a name brand product. The clipper blade would seize while trimming my neck line and pull my hair. Happened multiple times brand new out of the box after charging. Gave up and ran to wallyworld to purchase a Braun.
1/29/2019	Amazon	5	Needed trimming for his growing beard	"My 22 year old son needed a new beard trimmer for his growing beard and it did the job! As parents living in long distance, this is the best way to send him this product. Thanks!"
1/29/2019	Amazon	5	Great little trimmer for the price.	"I've had one of these for the past 10 years, it's still working but I thought it was time for a new one. I'd recommend this trimmer to anyone."
1/29/2019	Amazon	5	Great Product	"The guards are fragile, otherwise its great."
1/29/2019	Amazon	2	battery dies in a week - faulty product	"Amazon should take this off the site and remove it as their ""Amazon Choice"" product  I can confirm the other negative reviews for this one - the battery dies after only a few uses, and the power cord doesn't charge the trimmer as fast as it uses power, so you have to keep stopping to wait for a minute to charge, even when it's plugged in."
1/30/2019	Amazon	2	Not for hairy men	If you're a grown man with real hair I dont recommend this for personal grooming. Not enough power to trim hair down to even level unless gone over multiple times.
1/30/2019	Amazon	5	Great Baterry Life!!	"Easy to use, great battery life!! Over all all the pieces work excellent except one that should be used to trim, (Foil Shaver) basically it does not work for anything!  I use it once a week for a year now..."
1/30/2019	Amazon	1	Trash	"Had it less than a week and it died. Took it apart to see what was wrong. Most small battery operated electronics develop a faulty connection and are otherwise *perfectly fine* and fix-able :)  To my disappointment, it looks as though this shaver is cheaply made, with numerous points throughout where wires& solder make contact with other components, causing it o short out.  Disappointing to say the least. Hoping either the seller and/or Remington  reach out to make it better. Until then, Ill go back to my straight razor. No wires necessary;)  Edit: as a previous reviewer found, the battery is still a rechargeable AA. They did not make this unit with longevity in mind..."
1/30/2019	Amazon	5	Good trimmer.	Love this groomer. Works great.
1/30/2019	Amazon	5	Highly recommend	Great product!
1/30/2019	Amazon	5	Anything longer than about a half inch is to much beard for this	Not the best kit for longer beards. The attachement included tends to catch and trim down much lower than I would like. But works great other than that
1/30/2019	Amazon	5	Great for facial hair	Works great
1/31/2019	Amazon	4	Great battery life- needs to be sharper	Fantastic item for the price. I Wish it was a little sharper.
1/31/2019	Amazon	5	A good present!	"My boyfriend was very happy to receive the trimmer as a Christmas present. Good quality, affordable, and good service. Thanks!"
1/31/2019	Amazon	3	Cuts good but not close	Doesn't cut to close
1/31/2019	Amazon	1	Stopped working	I received this buzzer as a gift 4 months ago and it worked alright at the beginning but now it does not turn on even after charging. It lights up when charging but does not run when you flip the switch.
1/31/2019	Amazon	5	Great for breads	I love this product and accessories
1/31/2019	Amazon	1	It rusts	It rusted 2 weeks later. Bad quality
2/1/2019	Amazon	4	"Small, low noise, modern"	Excellent!
2/1/2019	Amazon	5	great price for much need device	works very well
2/1/2019	Amazon	5	Trimming made easy	Just what a well-groomed man needs!
2/1/2019	Amazon	5	I love this!	I got this for my boyfriend and it works wonders!
2/1/2019	Amazon	5	Good product	Very happy for my needs
2/1/2019	Amazon	4	Good product	"Works well, but like others have said, why is the holder so cheaply made?"
2/1/2019	Amazon	1	Dead	After a couple years the battery died.
2/2/2019	Amazon	5	It has most everything.	Works as expected.
2/2/2019	Amazon	5	Haircut	Hair
2/2/2019	Amazon	2	Not that good	Not having proper beard style set
2/2/2019	Amazon	2	Disappointed in this shaver	"This shaver is not working.  It was purchased as a Christmas present so didnt keep the receipt, expecting it to work.  Since I live outside of the USA (Americas region) I am unable to return it."
2/2/2019	Amazon	5	Good product	"Good price, good product, fast shipping"
2/2/2019	Amazon	1	Don't buy this product	Don't buy this product.  I haven't used it for even one time qnd it's broken already
2/2/2019	Amazon	5	works great	"has many attachments, works great!"
2/3/2019	Amazon	1	Not clean	The package was open. I found short hair inside the package and on the machine
2/3/2019	Amazon	3	Máquina de afeitar	No es muy buena
2/3/2019	Amazon	5	Grooming	Was a gift. He loves it
2/3/2019	Amazon	3	Cheap Adjustable Main Guide Comb	"The adjustable main guide comb is very cheap and flimsy. I lost 2 of the 6 teeth after only occasional use. You drop the trimmer from anything more than 6 inches, or lightly tap it to expell hair after use, and the teeth on the guide comb are likely to break. They should be much stronger. A replacement is like $9. That's almost half the price of the trimmer, and it's going to break as easily as the original. Other than that it's a nice trimmer, but I would not buy again just because of this."
2/3/2019	Amazon	3	This item broken after one week!!!!	This item adaptar broken  after one week!!!!
2/3/2019	Amazon	5	Very easy to switch the different shaver heads	I like all the attachments that camecwith the razor
2/3/2019	Amazon	1	Item Not Charging	I received item and it came already charged. I tried to charge item after i have exhausted the battery but item is not charging. I have tried it severally but item refused to charge. No value for money spent
2/4/2019	Amazon	5	Works hreat	Punctual delivery. Works great
2/4/2019	Amazon	5	good	great
2/4/2019	Amazon	1	Poor description of item	Dislike the attachments dont fit
2/4/2019	Amazon	2	"For a comfortable shave, buy a Norelco"	"I use this product to replace my old Norelco for trim facial hair, after using it a few times i regret not simply buying a new Norelco! This Remington shave pulls as much as it cut leading to a very uncomfortable trimming experiance. I will not purchase this trimmer again"
2/5/2019	Amazon	5	no complaints	works as expected.
2/5/2019	Amazon	5	Works great!	Great  grooming kit. Everything works great!
2/5/2019	Amazon	5	Nice product in this price	I just use the trimmer and the comb for shaving at home. I was having same earlier which lasts for almost 3 years after which its battery died.
2/5/2019	Amazon	4	Multifunctional	Multifunctional
2/5/2019	Amazon	1	died out	"before my first full charge the battery died out on me and is no longer usable even after a full day of charging.  pretty ticked off, used it for less than a week or two."
2/5/2019	Amazon	5	Good	Good
2/6/2019	Amazon	4	This is a good trimmer.	This is a a nice trimmer.  The cutting head is a little to wide for my liking.  They give you a smaller head but this one is to small. Ok I see a 3 bears Scenario coming up.
2/6/2019	Amazon	4	good quality	good quality
2/6/2019	Amazon	3	Not excellect but a decent one	I like the quality of product but performance is not that great. overall not bad to try this.
2/6/2019	Amazon	5	Great product	Works great. Does not pull. Lots of length options. Can't get it for twice the price.
2/7/2019	Amazon	4	Time for a haircut	Using on my handicapped son. Works really well. He usually throws a fit because of our old one was pretty loud. This one did a good job and not so loud.
2/7/2019	Amazon	5	It works	So far great vale for the price. Gets the job done.
2/7/2019	Amazon	5	Very simple	Haven't had it long but works well so far it did get kinda hot and cut did Nick the sweet potatoes
2/7/2019	Amazon	4	Works well!	"How is this appointment that the tray was just plastic, but this razor has been doing well for me!"
2/7/2019	Amazon	5	My beard trimmer	It has kept my beard and moustache trimmed aand easy to use
2/7/2019	Amazon	5	Nice	Good product
2/7/2019	Amazon	5	Great Customer Service	"Awesome shaver, great battery life, great customer service, two of the attachments weren't fitting so they sent replacements but one still didn't fit now they're sending an entire new upgraded model without requiring return of the first one, I'm enjoying my clean look beard, I only trim it every 2-3 days with joy:)"
2/7/2019	Amazon	5	Good trimmer.	"Good buy. Checks all the boxes. Light, charges fast, long battery life, good attachments, cuts well."
2/8/2019	Amazon	5	Great deal	Cheap and works great
2/8/2019	Amazon	4	Ease of use	Easy to use and very effective
2/8/2019	Amazon	3	Meh at best	"Works, not crazy about the features or attachments."
2/9/2019	Amazon	5	Great item	Use it daily.  Great item
2/10/2019	Amazon	1	NO LONGER CHARGING. Save your money!!	I purchased the product a few months back. I has used it only a handful of times. no longer holds charge. The charging light no longer illuminates during charging either. Horrible product I guess the only thing that is positive about this product is that is it fairly inexpensive yet a waste of money none the less. I would say save your cash for a better built product if you are currently in the market for something like this. I now have a half trimmed beard and a and a none working beard trimmer going straight to the trash.
2/11/2019	Amazon	5	Good trimmer	Good system overall. Didnt like the cheap plastic tray it comes with.
2/11/2019	Amazon	5	Nice product	Nice product
2/11/2019	Amazon	5	Awesome	Excellent deal for a beard trimmer.  Really enjoy using it
2/12/2019	Amazon	5	Thanks	Thanks
2/12/2019	Amazon	4	Uyil	Buen producto a buen precio
2/12/2019	Amazon	5	Long lasting battery charge	Easy to use very light weight
2/12/2019	Amazon	5	Valentine's Day ??	My man loved it
2/12/2019	Amazon	1	You get what you pay for	"I ordered this and this thing is one big nope, I turned it on expecting a Harleys davidson and instead I got a 10 year old moped with barely any gas ??"
2/13/2019	Amazon	1	I would not recommend this product	Purchased Jan 7. By February 12 it stopped working even after charging. Barely too late to return now.
2/13/2019	Amazon	4	You get what you pay for but still good!	Everything worked except the nosehair clippers they actually started making an awful scratching noise (probably a defect or the blade isnt aligned)! Other than that. The product is great and works on my thick facial hair!
2/14/2019	Amazon	5	Perfect	Item is as described. Works well.
2/14/2019	Amazon	5	Good product	Very handy
2/14/2019	Amazon	5	Does its job	"I bought this kit after my old trimmer died. I have yet to have any issues with it, it works perfectly."
2/15/2019	Amazon	5	Good beard trimmer	"Good beard trimmer, battery lasts a while."
2/15/2019	Amazon	5	Great for the Price	Works well
2/15/2019	Amazon	5	Good	"It was for a gift, the person love it"
2/15/2019	Amazon	5	Works well	"Been using for a long time now, still works like a charm."
2/15/2019	Amazon	5	Cuts great without scratches or nicks	Best beard shaver by a long margin.
2/15/2019	Amazon	2	"Terrible battery, good clippers"	"When I got the clippers they worked great, no complaints. The attachments were fast and simple to change, and the unit was convenient. After a month of use, the motor speed started to slow down. By three months use, the battery would not hold any charge, and would not even function while plugged in.  Save your money and buy a unit that will last more than a couple months."
2/15/2019	Amazon	5	Highly Recommended	Nice!
2/15/2019	Amazon	4	That they're cordless	Like that it's cordless
2/15/2019	Amazon	5	Great quality does the job	Husband loves it. Great gift keeps it all organized and visible.
2/16/2019	Amazon	5	AAA	"Comfortable,light good"
2/16/2019	Amazon	5	Great trimmer	"Love everything about this.  Great for beard trimming, general trimming, or even gently getting matted fur off a cat."
2/16/2019	Amazon	5	Great trimmer	"Love everything about this.  Great for beard trimming, general trimming, or even gently getting matted fur off a cat."
2/16/2019	Amazon	1	DO NOT BUY****	I saw the battery reviews and thought they just got defective units... TURNS OUT ITS TRUE. The charge that it came with lasted but it will NOT HOLD RECHARGE!!!!!!! And amazon will not refund you your money!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT. Spend a bit more money and get something professional
2/16/2019	Amazon	5	Great clippers	"Had a pair that lasted me years bought from tjmax for about 10 bucks.  2nd pair (this pair) bought because I fried 1st one using wrong charger recently.  Only problem I had was the plastic adjustment broke around year 2 or 3 on the first one, but I liked the adjustable length attachment when it worked.  New one came charged up and has been working great.  Easy to clean, never had problems even cleaning blades while on in the sink (though they don't recommend it).  Never rusted.  Will buy again if I destroy it but plan on having this for many years."
2/16/2019	Amazon	5	Best trimmer	Best trimmer
2/16/2019	Amazon	4	Grooming Kit	The set is easy to use and I am able to complete my shaving needs in a matter of minutes....charges very quickly.  It is a very nice set.
2/16/2019	Amazon	5	Works great for trimming beards	I have had this trimmer for over a year and it is still going strong. I use it to trim my beard or trimming the whole beard off about every six months or so. It is a good starter trimmer for boys peach fuzz on the face.
2/16/2019	Amazon	5	Smooth to shave	Best
2/17/2019	Amazon	5	Quality product!	Got this set for my son who has a beard. I used it to trim up his neck between haircuts and trim his beard. Works great!
2/17/2019	Amazon	1	Failed after one charge!	"It charged one time then the charger failed. Less than a week! The shaver itself is probably fine, but the transformer / +5V charger failed....0V!"
2/17/2019	Amazon	4	Whered this come from? I bought this?	Bought as a gift?
2/17/2019	Amazon	5	Works greak	Trims smooth and doesnt catch and pull like others that Ive used
2/18/2019	Amazon	5	Work perfectly	Working perfectly...
2/18/2019	Amazon	5	????	????
2/18/2019	Amazon	5	Great Gift	My fiance loves this gift. He uses it at least once a week. He likes all the different types of trimmers and how easy it is to use.

2/18/2019	Amazon	3	good shaver that did the job	"did not work as well as my old one, same brand less quality"
2/19/2019	Amazon	5	Very well made	Super quite and very sleek
2/19/2019	Amazon	5	Very well made	Super quite and very sleek
2/19/2019	Amazon	2	not impressed	"Pros: it had a full charge upon opening it  Cons: the flimsy plastic lightweight base that feels like it's disposable. razer foil won't cut ANYTHING it does not matter how much I trim my hair down, or how many directions, angles, passes I make. the foil does not cut anything. wasted attachment. nose trimmer doesn't trim anything. all in all, if I had a 2nd chance, I never would have ordered this."
2/19/2019	Amazon	5	Excellent easy to use..	Product was simple to use and worked great..
2/19/2019	Amazon	1	I want a refund	This shaved worked for 15 minutes and never came on again even after charging it for 6 hours... big waste of my money...
2/19/2019	Amazon	1	USELESS	"This electric trimmer is absolute garbage, it looses power VERY QUICKLY if not recharged after a few uses. I would recommend finding something made with a little more care."
2/19/2019	Amazon	1	Arrived with missing pieces	Arrived with some attachments missing.
2/19/2019	Amazon	5	Long lasting and durable battery	Affordable and high quality
2/20/2019	Amazon	5	Amazing	"I have been using it since the day one, just best thing i bought this year so far."
2/20/2019	Amazon	4	Nice! 10/10	"Came with charger, bag, and all the pieces."
2/20/2019	Amazon	1	Sold me a used product	Prudct arrived with clipper attachments loose and hair on it... disgusting
2/21/2019	Amazon	5	Great	I've been using for years
2/22/2019	Amazon	4	works well	works well for the price
2/22/2019	Amazon	2	Battery Failure	"I liked this trimmer and I used this trimmer about twice a month since purchased in October 2017. A rough estimate, if I ran it for 5 minutes each use, (I only have a very small light mustache). The battery won't take a charge anymore. Remington has had my loyalty for many years previously, now it seems that their product has gone the way of so many; China made ""throwaways"""
2/22/2019	Amazon	5	It works	It works well
2/22/2019	Amazon	4	El tiempo	Es útil
2/22/2019	Amazon	1	Do not waste your money	"Its waste of Money. Please do not buy it. I could not use even 10 times after finish my purchase. Everytime, it starts then withing 5-10 seconds it gets stop. Completely annoying."
2/22/2019	Amazon	5	Great.	"Easy to use, lightweight, does a nice job."
2/22/2019	Amazon	1	No charger	Charger did not come with it.  Charger wasn't included nor was it in the box. Looked liked it was opened.
2/23/2019	Amazon	5	Super sharp	Great product at a GREAT price....
2/23/2019	Amazon	5	????????????Beard  trimmer	My son likes it he said it cuts and trims his ????????Beard  up really good
2/23/2019	Amazon	5	Great Trimmer	Works perfect for my needs and for a great price!
2/23/2019	Amazon	4	Good for the price	"Arrived in a timely manner and is as described by seller.  It is smaller than I expected but is fine for my needs.  Has been working well for several months now,."
2/23/2019	Amazon	1	Garbage!!	Had for a month. Liked it.  Stopped taking a charge and it's NOT returnable. COMPLETELY DEAD. STAY AWAY!!
2/23/2019	Amazon	5	Daily Shave.	"Smooth shave whether clean shave, trim or five o clock shadow."
2/23/2019	Amazon	5	Would buy again!	This is great for the price. Purchased for my boyfriend and he has had no issues. Loves it.
2/24/2019	Amazon	1	what a mistike	Broke down after a week What a mistake was to buy this product !!
2/24/2019	Amazon	5	Great buy	Trims great
2/24/2019	Amazon	4	Gokd	God
2/24/2019	Amazon	1	Terrible	Didnt shave my husbands face at all. He doesnt have long hair either. We just wanted a fast shave and it wouldnt cut any of his hairs.
2/24/2019	Amazon	5	Perfect for price	Its so easy to use and great purchase for great price
2/25/2019	Amazon	5	Good quality	Works great
2/25/2019	Amazon	2	Not worth it	"I've had this razor for a little over 1 year and it died recently. It did the job, but it was underpowered from the start, even after a full charge. I'm going to spend a little more and buy a different one this time, hopefully something that will last a little longer."
2/25/2019	Amazon	5	Smooth with Skin when using it..	Does not come with Stand..
2/25/2019	Amazon	5	Best Trimmer EVER!	"This Thing is AMAZING! We have tried nearly every Trimmer that I could find. One Tugs, One Cuts skin too easily, One dies too quickly. Etc! This one is Amazing! ( So much so that I said ""Amazing"" twice) No cuts, Pulling or anything. And it cuts so close that It feels like the next morning after shaving. So Smooth without the chance of Razor Burn. Double Win! It charges fast and lasts for a really long time."
2/25/2019	Amazon	4	Great deal!	Great product. Love it!
2/25/2019	Amazon	5	Great buy.	Excellent!  Very pleased.
2/25/2019	Amazon	5	Nice	Worked great
2/25/2019	Amazon	4	Excelente	"Es perfecta,  me encantó"
2/25/2019	Amazon	1	Disappointed	"I recieved a used product that wouldn't work after an hour of charging. This is extremely disappointing, if I could give 0 stars I would."
2/25/2019	Amazon	5	Will not let you down...Small Machine Big Abilities	Great for grooming very good for shaping moustache... Did my haircut on the very first day out of the box
2/25/2019	Amazon	1	Dont shave head with it	This shaver is only good for thin hair areas.  Tried shaving my head which does not have much hair. Had trouble shaving and was pulling my hair. This shaver is only good to shave face or body.
2/26/2019	Amazon	3	Replaced within a week	There are so many better ones out there
2/26/2019	Amazon	5	Nice & even trims!	No complaints. Works good
2/26/2019	Amazon	1	"light, cheap, doesn't do well for big beards or really anything."	Not sure why anyone even made this?... Dont use it. You will ruin your beard.
2/26/2019	Amazon	2	Poor Battery	"When new, it seemed like the clippers never ran out of battery.  I have a beard and only occasionally use them to trim.  It seemed like I only remember charging them once or twice until I spent the last 3-4 months letting my beard grow out.  Pulled them out this morning to ""clean up,"" the worked for maybe 60 seconds before they died.  Figured the battery just had finally run out from the last time I used it.  Plugged them in and went to work...  came home to finish trimming to have it run for 30 sec before it died.  If it worked like the first few months I owned them, would strongly recommend, but I prefer to buy something that lasts, not that I have to constantly replace at irregular intervals."
2/26/2019	Amazon	5	??????????	all i can say is i love my razor.keeps a good long charge
2/27/2019	Amazon	1	Not what I expected	Everything
2/28/2019	Amazon	5	They are great	My son had no complaints. He complains about everything lol
2/28/2019	Amazon	5	Great bargain and works great.	My husband loves this!
2/28/2019	Amazon	5	Works well	Use it for all my hair removal needs even shaved my head with it.
2/28/2019	Amazon	1	Avoid this trash	Worked well until it ran out of battery. Battery never racharged not even after being left plugged in for 24 hrs and still wouldn't turn on. Went straight to the trash where it belongs. DO NOT BUY.
2/28/2019	Amazon	2	Price is fools gold.	"Razor irritated my skin. Shave isnt that close for electric razor standards. Its a cheap razor set, but you get what you pay for."
2/28/2019	Amazon	4	Handy	"Small enough to travel, has everything I need for grooming."
2/28/2019	Amazon	5	Muy bueno	Muy bueno
3/1/2019	Amazon	5	Works well	"Does what it needs to do, no complaints"
3/1/2019	Amazon	5	Bought in 2016. Still going.	"May have lost some battery life, but other than that it's a great tool for everyday shaving."
3/1/2019	Amazon	5	Would buy again.	Really like the feel of this shaver. Gets very close to your skin without cutting you. And the added attachments make it a much better value. Only thing I really did like is the little stand it comes with. Threw it in the trash first day.
3/1/2019	Amazon	5	Great trimmer!	Works great! Love the adjustable guide.
3/1/2019	Amazon	1	Won't buy again	The razor itself worked great when I got it but after a few months the tip of it Broke off and I was unable to use it anymore because the blades were completely expose
3/1/2019	Amazon	5	Exceeded my expectations	"Battery life is amazing, plenty of attachments and works great at least for short beard"
3/1/2019	Amazon	5	Works great!	Works great
3/2/2019	Amazon	1	This sucks!	It quit working after 6 months.
3/2/2019	Amazon	5	Does the trick	Got for my husband and my dad. They both love it. My husband is able to get a really crisp look when lining up his beard so I say get it!
3/2/2019	Amazon	5	Nice trimmer	A great trimmer set with all of the accessories you'll need and excellent battery life.
3/2/2019	Amazon	1	Good product but didnt work for me	"I was planning to shave with this, but it didnt work for ME. The offset between the moving blades and the stationary part of the cutting head is too great to cut my very short stubble. That said, the product itself is well made with good attachments. It also has good power."
3/2/2019	Amazon	5	Reminton shaver	has a wide selection of trimmer combs
3/2/2019	Amazon	5	as advertised	as advertised
3/2/2019	Amazon	4	5 years	Ive had it for 5 years. Works as expected for a 20 dollar trimmer
3/3/2019	Amazon	4	"good quality, but shortest length could be shorter"	"good quality, but shortest length could be shorter"
3/3/2019	Amazon	5	Quality is great	"I bought this for my boyfriend because his previous one was old and I accidentally broke it- ha ! But he absolutely loves it, sleek, compact and the blade is nice and sharp. Honestly lasts forever"
3/3/2019	Amazon	1	Doesn't last long	I on average used this once every two weeks and a month ago it stopped holding a charge for more than one use and now does not hold one at all. It barely lasted 4 months and at an average of one use every two weeks that means it was used less than 10 times before breaking
3/3/2019	Amazon	4	Happy with the purchase	When product arrived the foil shaver attachment was missing. Got in touch with the manufacturer and got the piece quickly.
3/3/2019	Amazon	1	Batter not holding charge	It's only been like 6 months and the battery stopped holding a charge. Very disappointing for a Remington product. I do not recommend.
3/4/2019	Amazon	3	Good enough	For the price it works just fine
3/4/2019	Amazon	1	worst ever	Product stopped working after 2 charges. Unbelievably bad product
3/4/2019	Amazon	5	light and durable	This works great for my beard and for the price you cant go wrong.
3/4/2019	Amazon	2	Not very powerful	Don't waste your money on this rechargeable trimmer.  The charge doesn't seem to last long and it isn't as powerful as the Philips Norelco Multi Groomer.
3/5/2019	Amazon	5	Shaves perfect ????	Love it
3/5/2019	Amazon	5	I stuck with REMINGTON!	"I bought this device to replace my old one. I'd had it for years, more then I can remember actually. I lost track of mine during a deer hunting. I didn't take into the woods, but somehow lost track of it. And as it turns out I'm glad I did. This device comes with more attachments (blade types) than my old one. And a couple have been very useful. But the best part is, they've made a lot progress on the batteries since I bought my first one. This device seems to charge fairly quickly and holds a charge very well. And while I so far haven't run it completely flat on a charge. I'm getting a lot of usage on a single charge. It's a little larger in diameter than my old one. That may be why it holds it's charge so well. That slightly larger diameter makes it easier to hold onto and maneuver around as you work to get to awkward spots. It does a great job on the spots you'd expect, but it can be used safely (I have so far) on my intimate areas than your nose, ears, or hairline. It feels solid/well built, and I would recommend to anyone."
3/5/2019	Amazon	4	Nice travel grooming kit	Nice kit with lots of options. Battery life is good have gone an entire week of daily use on one charge. Don't plane on using the shaving head for daily whole face shaves. Shaving head is too small and only good for shaping or trimming.
3/5/2019	Amazon	3	Lasted 6 months	"worked well. The battery failed after 6 months. It has a single AA battery, so I tried to replace it, but it's glued in place. It did it's job, but I wont buy another one"
3/6/2019	Amazon	4	Good for a trimmer	"Pros: If you want to trim your beard to be very short, this works well. Also has great battery life; it's been about 3 months since I bought it and I've never charged it after the initial charge.  Cons: Few options. For 1/5 the price of some shavers, don't expect it to have all the bells and whistles of an expensive Norelco/Phillips razor. This thing does not give a clean shave, but it's good enough to keep a mustache from appearing on your face every couple days."
3/6/2019	Amazon	4	Good little trimmer	"Good trimmer for keeping your beard. Wish motor was little more powerful, but it gets the job done."
3/6/2019	Amazon	4	Great Trimmer	Easy to use and maneuver. Long lasting battery.
3/6/2019	Amazon	4	as expected	"as expected, cheap"
3/7/2019	Amazon	5	Amazing product	"I gave this to my teenage son for Christmas and its been dropped, slammed, and slightly submerged and its held up great. The stand makes it look nice and organized in the drawer. He loves it and loves all the attachments. I recommend this trimmer kit."
3/8/2019	Amazon	1	Battery DEAD after 3-4 charges	this product should have lasted more than 3-4 charge cycles. It didn't. bye bye $20 because I cannot return it now.
3/8/2019	Amazon	5	Great Product	Works perfect. Great for all of my face and body trimming needs. Great value.
3/9/2019	Amazon	5	Great product	"Great product, just what was needed"
3/10/2019	Amazon	5	Perfect! Cuts great.	"Love, this is the second one we purchased. My son and husband said it cuts perfect."
3/10/2019	Amazon	5	Best shave you can get	Diffnly get a good shave whit these
3/10/2019	Amazon	5	Trimmer	Trimming mustache and around ears.
3/11/2019	Amazon	5	I don't even use a razor anymore	This thing shaves so close I don't have to use my razor anymore quick and easy
3/11/2019	Amazon	5	Very useful	Very useful
3/11/2019	Amazon	1	loses its charge within 1 month	I bought this beard trimmer as a gift and it lost its charge after 1 month of use. Now the return window is closed. This is so rediculous. Terrible quality and return policy through Amazon
3/12/2019	Amazon	5	OMG	This is perfect. Love the pouch to keep everything together. Everything you need for male grooming.
3/12/2019	Amazon	3	Grabs and pinches without guard.	I got this trimmer and the Phillip's Norelco one and have to say that the head on this is not as smooth and will occasionally grab and pull so a close comfortable trim with no attachment is not as easy with this one. Kinda flimsy and light weight.
3/12/2019	Amazon	5	Good shaver.	"Very light weight,  does it's job."
3/12/2019	Amazon	1	Not satisfied	This cut very poorly. I cant get close to even line properly. Very dull. Wouldnt recommend.
3/12/2019	Amazon	5	works great	Especially like the close trimmer
3/12/2019	Amazon	4	Gift	Bought as a gift. Works well
3/13/2019	Amazon	4	Great price	"Great options for a great price, could be sharper but it works"
3/13/2019	Amazon	5	It Cuts my beard great	"It works great i love it, thank you"
3/13/2019	Amazon	5	Works great	Great product
3/13/2019	Amazon	1	junk	"this is a product which amazon should not be selling and should refund all the customers who had  bought this product,as this doesnt work even out of the box .i had bought 2 by mistake and both are  dead on arrival .unfortunately didnt open  the boxes till late so couldnt even return it to get my money back"
3/13/2019	Amazon	5	Great Trimmer. Good Battery Life.	Ive had the trimmer for over a month now and it works great.  Charged the battery when I received it and havent charged it since. I use it twice a week to trim my beard. Cuts without pulling your hair.  The attachments are nice too.
3/13/2019	Amazon	5	Works	Works well when keeping my beard trimmed
3/13/2019	Amazon	5	Very pleased	Fast shipping and good quality product.
3/13/2019	Amazon	5	Recommend	Holds charge and works great
3/13/2019	Amazon	3	Could be better!	Its a good shaver but over time the hair starts gathering on the inside of the device and the only way to clean it is to unscrew the top. This is a hassle for me. Other shavers are easily detachable to clean.
3/13/2019	Amazon	2	It works fine.	"It actually cuts really well, and gives a nice close shave. My problem with this shaver is that it pulls my hair. If a hair moves between the cutter head and head housing, it grabs hold and won't let go. This is very painful and really annoying. It's unavoidable if you are touching up next to your beard. I'm no sure how many hairs I've yanked out by the roots, but it isn't fun, and it's always unexpected. ouch. Not quite bad enough to return, but if there was a better option available, I might have."
3/14/2019	Amazon	5	great buzzer	"minimal irritation when using this buzzer, gets a close shave and easy to use the attachements would recommend it"
3/14/2019	Amazon	5	Worked well at a good price	Works good
3/14/2019	Amazon	1	Broken	"Broke after few use,, very disappointing,"
3/15/2019	Amazon	1	BUY SOMETHING ELSE	"Deserves a 0 star rating! This is less than a child's toy. Shaves in streaks in every setting and attachment. If you look at it to hard the pieces will fall out of it's self contained assembly. Please!!!..buy something else,maybe a gas powered weed trimmer."
3/15/2019	Amazon	4	Good item	Good peoduct
3/16/2019	Amazon	5	??	??
3/16/2019	Amazon	5	Still working well!	Well made. Works great on my husbands thick and coarse facial hair.
3/16/2019	Amazon	5	Good product	Great setup and no cord
3/16/2019	Amazon	5	"Good quality, lightweight and long lasting charge"	"I use this clipper set for grooming my dog's face and feet so may not be comparable for others' purposes.  However, it is lightweight, quiet, works very well and the charge is long lasting.  I use it several times without recharging.  It is convenient and easy to use."
3/16/2019	Amazon	5	Great groooming kit	"Well made and portable, I've taken it on the road and have been very satisfied with it as it is compact and capable of doing everything I could ask from a groomer."
3/16/2019	Amazon	5	Solid product	Solid product
3/16/2019	Amazon	1	Dont waste your time.	Worthless! It worked great for a week but stopped working.
3/17/2019	Amazon	1	"Cheaply Built, Under Powered, Non-Returnable"	"I have been using a Wahl Peanut for years and as it slowly began to die I decided to try a cordless trimmer - one less cord to worry about around the sink.  This Remington was cheap and had a bunch of great reviews so I gave it a go.  I didn't even make it through one shave before boxing it back up.  The device is very cheaply made and very light-weight.  The attachments seem gimmicky and snap to the heads poorly.  The 'stand' is a thin plastic shell no better than most packing materials.  The motor is very tiny and weak.  I had to go over my beard and sideburn stubble multiple times to get anything close to a smooth shave and that resulted in irritation.  To top it off, this item is labelled as non-returnable.  I understand that there is a hygiene issue with reselling an item like this but something so poorly built should be the seller's problem, not the customer's.  Luckily Amazon customer service was able to make things right but it was a hassle to return what felt more like a toy than a grooming device.  If you need a quality trimmer for regular use avoid this.  I'm not sure if all cordless trimmers suffer the same issues however I will be going back to my peanut."
3/17/2019	Amazon	5	Great for goatee management	Husband uses this daily  and I love the trimmed look!
3/17/2019	Amazon	5	Just as described	Just as described
3/17/2019	Amazon	5	gets the job done. great value	gets the job done. great value
3/18/2019	Amazon	5	Can be tough to clean	"Smaller than I thought, but works"
3/19/2019	Amazon	5	Great	Great thanks
3/20/2019	Amazon	5	"Fast shipping,good product"	"Perfect for my son,ty."
3/20/2019	Amazon	5	works	works
3/20/2019	Amazon	5	worth the money	very nice and sharp . battery is great on it . attachments are good . does not feel cheap when holding it like some others
3/21/2019	Amazon	5	Great item	Good item does the job. My lady loves the fresh cut trim all over the body.
3/21/2019	Amazon	1	Trimming or not	Well l wanted to use this product to trim my face hair but unfortunately this product didnt work
3/22/2019	Amazon	5	Works great very robust and cuts clean	"Love that these clippers were available, they work like a charm."
3/22/2019	Amazon	1	Extremely poor quality with regards to energy storage and use	"The product worked well...that is until it neededto be charged. Then, it decided it did not want to charge at all and continually died out after only running for one second intervals. By the time i needed to recharge it, i had already surpassed the return date and have been left with a product that barely made it outside the factory. It is upsetting since it performed so well the 6 or 7 uses that i got out of it."
3/22/2019	Amazon	5	Good & economical	Works great!
3/22/2019	Amazon	5	"Buy it, it works."	Works great! Clean and smooth.
3/23/2019	Amazon	2	Ok	"Ok product, hate the tray holder takes up too much room and slides off."
3/23/2019	Amazon	5	It awesome	"Great product, prefer this to shaving, does it fast, no time wasted. Comes with charger."
3/23/2019	Amazon	5	Just what I needed.	Battery lasts for ever. I only use it every 2-3 weeks and its still on its first charge several months later.
3/24/2019	Amazon	1	Junk	Product stopped working after it needed to be charged. Total waste of money.
3/24/2019	Amazon	5	Shaver	Very nice shaver
3/24/2019	Amazon	1	prefect for one time used	"This is my second time ordering this. First one stop working and Amazon was giving me too much of a hustle, So i ordered again and after my second use This stopped working again...Def not going to order it a third time. Called multiple times and I was told I was going to get a call back ."
3/24/2019	Amazon	5	Good product	Trim nicely
3/24/2019	Amazon	5	High quality product	Very high quality blades. The attachments work really well. Especially the adjustable cutting length attachment.
3/25/2019	Amazon	5	Really Nice Manscaping Device	I love the way this device feels in your hand when you go to use it. It's small enough that it doesn't feel bulky and has the attachments to allow you to do a variety of things that are important to making sure you look your best. The battery life seems to be very good as well. Cleaning it when done is super simple. I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this but it met my needs perfectly.
3/25/2019	Amazon	5	ok	good
3/25/2019	Amazon	4	"Decent trimmer, adjustable guard broke quickly."	"If you just plan on using the trimmer or the small assortment of plastic guards it comes with, it'll probably work fine. I've been using it for about a year now and haven't had issues with those parts.  Unfortunately the adjustable guard (the clear plastic one that slides up and down) broke pretty quickly and no longer stays in place (meaning the length constantly changes while I'm shaving--not very useful).  Still it's a decent buy for the money, and you mostly get what you pay for."
3/26/2019	Amazon	5	Great	I've used a couple different machines and this one has been the easiest on the private area... HIGHLY recommend if that's what you're getting it for and definitely worth the price.
3/26/2019	Amazon	5	Good Quality!	Good Quality!
3/26/2019	Amazon	2	Terrible quality.	"Adjustable guard broke after a few months use of LIGHT use. Not dropped or anything, just didn't stay at the adjusted setting anymore. But when It worked, it was great!"
3/27/2019	Amazon	4	good shavers	"good shavers, they don't get as close as I would like but work great"
3/27/2019	Amazon	5	Good cordless clipper set	Works as advertised
3/27/2019	Amazon	5	Works great	Delivered quickly and in working condition. It works great!
3/27/2019	Amazon	2	Didnt last	Nice while it worked. Stopped working within 3 months
3/28/2019	Amazon	1	It pulled up my hair not shape	It a garbage
3/28/2019	Amazon	3	didnt last	did his job
3/28/2019	Amazon	1	Received it used and broken !	Received it used and broken !
3/29/2019	Amazon	1	BOUGHT TWICE BROKE TWICE	Purchased this items twice and if failed within a month both times. AVOID
3/31/2019	Amazon	5	Works as Promised	Battery lasts a good time and there are lots of extra attachments.
4/1/2019	Amazon	3	Mine dulled way too fast	"I bought this trimmer 8 months ago (in September), right before I began growing out my beard for the winter.  Since then, I've probably used it about 10 times, mostly just to keep my neck clean and occasionally trim back my beard.  In that time, not only has the trimmer dulled incredibly fast (to the point where the teeth don't cut, they rip) but the trimmer has also grown incredibly loud to the point where my family could hear me shave from the other side of the house behind 2 closed doors.  My father has this same one, which is the reason I bought this one.  His is fine, despite it being about 2.5 years old.  In a way this review is for the both of us.  His is great, mine sucks."
4/2/2019	Amazon	2	Long Lasting!? Nope	"I liked this product and its accesories, however disappointed that after a year, my Remington will not charge up anymore....looking for a new trimmer set now."
4/3/2019	Amazon	5	works great	??
4/3/2019	Amazon	3	Good not great	This trimmer works well for about a year and then the battery stops holding a charge. I've used two of these and both typically lasted a year maybe a year and a half. After that the battery barely lasts long enough to cut my hair.  I'd recommend getting a trimmer that runs off of a chord so you don't have to worry about a battery charge.
4/3/2019	Amazon	5	Needs to have a small brush to clean it.	Works very well on the face. If you use it on the body it will bite. And it has scratched more than once.
4/3/2019	Amazon	4	They just need to improve the stand.. and maybe a different type of accessory that's useful	The only thing I didn't like about it is that the the stand doesn't hold all the accessories in place it's too loose.
4/4/2019	Amazon	1	DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. DO NOT BUY THIS ONE.	"I first bought this razor like early last year and it worked fine for a good few months. then, randomly, it just stopped working one day. i charged it for hella long, and it just wouldn't work. I thought it may have been a defect or something. so i bought another one, crossing my fingers, and this one broke after like a week. i got maybe one (1) good use out of it. please don't waste your money on this cheaply made, mediocre razor. 0/10 not worth it! ??"
4/4/2019	Amazon	5	Nice	My son likes it
4/4/2019	Amazon	5	Ok	Ok
4/4/2019	Amazon	5	Great little trimmer.	Bought this trimmer to replace my old trimmer that wouldn't hold a charge any more.  Well worth the price.
4/4/2019	Amazon	5	LOVE IT!!!	"Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my husband, and HE LOVES IT!"
4/4/2019	Amazon	5	Great Little Clipper	"Small size, easy to use. I use it on head and beard."
4/5/2019	Amazon	5	Staying so fresh and so clean	"Pimping ain't easy, but this kit has me looking good as I do it"
4/5/2019	Amazon	5	Works famously	Great gift idea.  He loved it
4/6/2019	Amazon	5	Great Gift	Bought as a gift for my son. He likes the Remington All In One. This was a great gift.
4/6/2019	Amazon	5	Great item!	A hit under the Christmas tree.
4/6/2019	Amazon	5	Nice quality	Husband enjoyed getting this as a gift
4/6/2019	Amazon	5	Good buy	Good product good price what more can you ask for.
4/6/2019	Amazon	5	Good	Good product I bought it for my bf and he really likes and likes all the different sizes
4/7/2019	Amazon	5	Excellent product!	"These clippers are awesome, i have been using them for many many months now, battery is long lasting and everything is as described in the description!!"
4/7/2019	Amazon	2	Worked great until it stopped. This product only worked a couple of months	I purchased this Remington grooming kit PG6025 for my husband as a Christmas present to replace another brand shaver we had had for many years before it stopped working.  I am very disappointed that this product stopped working after a few months.  I would not recommend this product.
4/7/2019	Amazon	1	Stopped working after 4 months	Battery died after 4 months. Very disappointing...
4/8/2019	Amazon	1	pesisma	la compre hace tres meses y ya no funciona
4/8/2019	Amazon	4	Item is as pictured	Nice
4/9/2019	Amazon	5	For basics. Not precision	Small jobs only. Not barber sharp but it gets the job done for basics
4/9/2019	Amazon	4	Works well taming the hair.	It does exactly what it needs to. I haven't had any issues yet.
4/9/2019	Amazon	1	Utterly useless outside of the Americas	"There should be a clear warning about its weird voltage requirements in the description. It does not work unless you're in the Americas. Apparently, there it's common to have 110v sockets. It's not something one normally pays attention to where I'm located."
4/10/2019	Amazon	1	Body attachments didn't work	I purchased this to use for my body but the attachments did not work. I then tried to trim without the attachments and ended up cutting myself. Do not purchase this if you intend to for body use.
4/10/2019	Amazon	5	Meets many needs	Met all my expectations
4/10/2019	Amazon	5	Multi devices ????	Good
4/11/2019	Amazon	4	Works well	Tbh I needed a clipper to shave down below and yes it works it is a solid 4 stars because it does its job as a clipper the only thing is that it feels very cheap which is expected but it has very thin plastic so be careful not to drop it!
4/11/2019	Amazon	1	Garbage	I might as well have let a turtle nibble on my face to remove the hair.  There i little to no power and the blade is really dull.
4/12/2019	Amazon	3	OK Clipper	"It is a lot smaller that the image suggests, and not very powerful."
4/12/2019	Amazon	5	Great purchase	Very good product.
4/13/2019	Amazon	1	They don't last long.	I had two of these and none lasted more than 6 months.
4/13/2019	Amazon	5	Buy it	Works great
4/14/2019	Amazon	5	Husband approved	Hubby likes it. Had it for almost two years now I believe. And hasnt been complaining about it so its worth the money
4/15/2019	Amazon	5	great trimmer great price.	high quality trimmer and the price is good too.  big bang for the buck.
4/15/2019	Amazon	3	Doesnt hold charge for long enough	Not like the pictures. If the one guard breaks Ill have to buy a whole new one.
4/15/2019	Amazon	5	Economical and easy use	Very nice beard trimmer
4/15/2019	Amazon	5	Excelente producto	Excelente producto
4/15/2019	Amazon	1	Garbage	"This didn't last long. Hair gets clogged into the trimmer head and becomes jammed mid-shave. The hole for cleaning the inside is so small that it is impossible to full clear the clogged unit. The inside must be rusting, too, because when I first start the trimmer, it seizes up until I manually move the cutter back and forth under water. I am buying another unit as we speak - spend a little extra and get a better brand."
4/15/2019	Amazon	5	Great!	everything in one...great for son to father
4/15/2019	Amazon	5	Satisfacción	Muy bueno
4/16/2019	Amazon	1	Not very happy with the product will not buy again.	Battery last on a full charge maybe one or two uses. Not very happy with the product will not buy again.
4/16/2019	Amazon	4	Easy to use	Very easy to use. I got it for my neckline and it cleans up nice.
4/16/2019	Amazon	3	I got a year and couple months out of it...	"... But it only cost, at the time, $12.00. I ordered the identical item because I can cannibalize the parts. For some odd reason the battery died - even plugged in it will not work."
4/17/2019	Amazon	1	Battery	"Just like the other 1 star reviews, this razor does not hold its battery after the first couple of charges. I have had this razor for only 2 weeks and it already has died on me and does not charge up again. Save your money and invest in a better/more reliable razor."
4/17/2019	Amazon	5	Great Product	"My husband loves his, and said he would be another one."
4/18/2019	Amazon	2	No good	Really wasn't strong enough to cut my boyfriend's facial hair. Didn't even work on eyebrow hair.
4/18/2019	Amazon	5	Love these	Easy to use.
4/18/2019	Amazon	2	The clear adjustable length piece is not accurate.	The clear adjustable length piece is not accurate and cut my beard way too short.
4/18/2019	Amazon	5	Good quality and good fit	There were many different sized combs to choose from and it holds a charge very well. It also has a really smooth cut that allows me to just glide through my shave with minimal effort.
4/18/2019	Amazon	4	Decent for short beard maintance	I use this once a week to trim a short beard.  I usually go several months between charges without issue.  Had the device for a couple years now.  Still happy with it.
4/19/2019	Amazon	5	Perfect	Good
4/19/2019	Amazon	1	"Worked Great at the Begining, Doesnt work at all now"	"Works great when it works, but after a few months It stopped holding a charge and it will not turn on anymore no matter how long I charge it for"
4/19/2019	Amazon	4	Works	"More accessories than I need, but it does well for my purpose which is mainly moustache trimming.  Have only had to recharge once, actually when it was new."
4/19/2019	Amazon	5	No problems	It works well
4/20/2019	Amazon	5	Nice Shaver and trimmer!	I was hesitant about purchasing but I am Glad I did!!
4/20/2019	Amazon	5	Buy it!	"I bought mine at  CVS 5 years ago. Love it! Battery lasts sharp blades and no issues! Well worth the money! I trim eyebrows, beard, chest and groin.  Awesome product!"
4/20/2019	Amazon	5	works great	nice trimmer works great
4/20/2019	Amazon	2	Unsatisfactory body hair trimming	"The product does not perform well while used for body trimming. I like the design and having a blade parallel to the handle, but the hair is not getting picked up"
4/21/2019	Amazon	5	Great Trimmer with every attachment	Great little trimmer fantastic to take on an emergency call out or a 3 day VACATION
4/22/2019	Amazon	4	Graet Trimmer For The Price	Wasn't sure I'd keep my beard after growing one for the first time this past winter but this trimmer has been great for the price for me to keep the beard!
4/22/2019	Amazon	5	Excellent	Long strong battery and great overall trimmer.
4/22/2019	Amazon	3	Okay trimmer with battery issues	The battery indicator never worked and battery life is maybe 30 mins.
4/22/2019	Amazon	2	Broke suddenly after ~5 years--possibly from high humidity.	Just stopped working.
4/23/2019	Amazon	1	Stopped Working After 3 Months	The razor worked for about 3 months- then completely stopped working. Hopefully I can get a refund or get it replaced...
4/23/2019	Amazon	5	maquinilla para rasural	"muy facil uso, largo uso de la bateria muy comoda"
4/24/2019	Amazon	5	Great	Great
4/24/2019	Amazon	1	No testing of product before selling	I bought this item in 2018 but this item is not working since its first day. Plus i gifted this product to someone so felt very much insulted because it was not working. After sometime later they told me about this problem so i cant do anything now but its shameful that an unused product is not working and i paid whatever was price .
4/25/2019	Amazon	1	Do not buy	This stopped working after 3 months
4/26/2019	Amazon	5	Muchas gracias	Muy buen producto de verdad se los agradezco
4/26/2019	Amazon	4	Small compact great for travel best on smaller surfaces	For the price its great I just dont like how its too small its definitely for precision and smaller surfaces but if youre in a rush you will miss out on some hairs.
4/27/2019	Amazon	4	Great value! Fast shipping	"Only used around 10 times, but works great so far.  Variety of attachments and you can't be the value for the price."
4/29/2019	Amazon	4	No more beard!	It was a gift. My son had one but no charger.  Cheaper to buy new than to replace charger.
4/29/2019	Amazon	5	Long battery life	Works great. Just wish it had a price that had a guard to adjust for length. Very recommended
4/30/2019	Amazon	5	Painless.	"I can keep my beard trimmed, the sides of my head shaved, and my lowered beard trim."
4/30/2019	Amazon	5	Great for hairy men!	"My boyfriend loves this product because he can trim his beard, chest, and anything else so easily. The small head makes it great for having control. The many attachments make manscaping so easy. Great idea for Fathers Day!"
5/2/2019	Amazon	1	Bad battery	Worked well after 2-3 weeks battery died first time and could not charge ut anymore
5/3/2019	Amazon	3	trimmer	"trims my beard well. am not impressed with most of the blades, don't like the nose hair attachment either as it doesn't seem to cut the hairs in my nose."
5/4/2019	Amazon	2	The blades get stuck in your skin...	"I am not happy with the product, rather sad that I had heard good things about Remington, but this product is not up to the mark. I understand that the price is low and you get what you pay for, but the blades should not be so flimsy and plastic-ie that when you shave, they get stuck in your skin... I used it twice, both times I had cuts on my skin and I don't intend on trying a third time."
5/5/2019	Amazon	5	Great	My husband really liked it.
5/6/2019	Amazon	3	"Weak motor, its cheap and rightfully so."	"The charger on my more expensive, five year old, trimmer got lost in a move.  When I let my beard just go for too long, I bought this for the Remington brand and low price.  For the money spent, quality is about to be expected. After a full 24 hours on a charge, the motor still groans at varying speed, up-and-down, as if its almost dead. Ive used it three times, using only the guide attachment and bare blade to clean up my beard. As I stated before, its adequate...but Ill probably need to replace it with something of higher quality fairly soon."
5/6/2019	Amazon	5	Great product	Great for men and easy to use with a powerful battery !!!!
5/6/2019	Amazon	5	Battery Life IS LONG LASTING	Love the battery life. Literally charged it once and I shave weekly. Havent charged it since and going on 8 months
5/7/2019	Amazon	5	Great buy	Battery life is great and trimmer is sharp and doesn't pull or grab hairs.
5/7/2019	Amazon	5	NICE	JUST WHAT I NEEDED
5/8/2019	Amazon	5	Love it	Love it
5/8/2019	Amazon	5	"Do your grooming in the bathroom. Depending on your hairiness, it will get messy."	"As soon as I open the box I tried this bad boy out. I have been growing my facial hair for about 2 months and lets just say it wasnt ganna be an easy test for this little guy. Handled beautifully. Had to use multiple attachments and got a feel for each one on what they do in certain areas. Clean up was a breeze. Items were very organized and had no hassle storing away. Cant give a full review, based on out of the box, yet but will definitely keep for future use. Definitely worth my money. FYI tho be careful opening the box. Idk how I did it but I cut myself on something. I wasnt using a sharp object to open the package. Just a pair of Keys."
5/8/2019	Amazon	5	LOVE IT	"I am a woman, I use it instead of a razor or a women's shaver. Its easy to use, rechargeable, and good quality."
5/8/2019	Amazon	5	I love it	So far so good
5/8/2019	Amazon	3	Works	Cause I want to
5/9/2019	Amazon	4	no chafing	It dose the job I want it to
5/9/2019	Amazon	2	Good product if it never is near water	"Great trimmer until I rinsed the head of it once. Continues to hold a charge but will not turn on any more. If you buy one, keep it away from water."
5/9/2019	Amazon	5	Works for me	Great for 5oclock shadows
5/10/2019	Amazon	3	"Ok for thin body hair, unable to cut coarse beard hair or even trim shadows"	"This is a good body groomer. If you have fine body hair. Its worthless to me as a beard/mustache groomer. The blades are so closely spaced my beard hairs dont even make it between to cut it. It cant even clear up stubble to sculpt a beard. Whats worse is after 2 weeks of having it and realizing this misrepresentation of being a beard groomer, I for some reason am unable to return it. Be advised. Trimming thin body hair, ok. Thicker stubble...outright stinks. Stuck with it now so Ill gave to use a better trimmer for my face."
5/10/2019	Amazon	5	grooming kit	My husband purchased this item so far so good no issues found.
5/10/2019	Amazon	1	Nope	"If you are buying this item to trim your ""nether regions"", forget it. It just doesn't work. And frankly, the other attachements don't work that great either. Very disappointed."
5/10/2019	Amazon	2	Arrived poorly and meh attachments	"The quality I received the item was less than good. I am not a fan of wondering if this was a used item. The trimmer itself seems pretty solid, but the attachments are awkward to put on and dont seem to do much."
5/10/2019	Amazon	5	Long battery life.	"We use this mainly for cutting my husband's hair and beard and maintaining my undercut which it's perfect for. The battery lasts forever after a single charge. I like all the different adjustment clips, helps with blending around the front and nape of neck. All in all would recommend if you want a nice trimmer at home."
5/10/2019	Amazon	5	Good price.	"Huge battery life, versatile, easy to clean, and high value for money. Good pick."
5/11/2019	Amazon	1	Junk	"Junk, it only worked once out of the box after that it would not recharge. Dont buy this product."
5/11/2019	Amazon	5	Nice Personal Clipper Set!	Very nice personal trimmer-love all the different attachments! Also runs very smoothly and quietly too!
5/11/2019	Amazon	5	Durable	Good product
5/11/2019	Amazon	1	JUNK !!!	Pure Junk.  Recharged this item a couple of times.  Then quit for good.  Don't waste your money.
5/12/2019	Amazon	5	Easy to use. Cordless	"Cordless, charges fast.  Easy to switch.  Would recommend."
5/12/2019	Amazon	5	Great trimmer. Fantastic Price	"Previously bought one of these trimmers and it finally died.  The new one I got charged faster, cut cleaner and was not as noisy"
5/12/2019	Amazon	1	Do not purchase	Stop working. Only used this once... Waste of money
5/12/2019	Amazon	1	Arrived warped	Doesn't fit the phone properly because it's warped
5/13/2019	Amazon	5	Amazing	"This is a full set of trimmers. for me, i don't have to much body or face hair. It's to much for me."
5/13/2019	Amazon	5	Awesome Trimmer	Best cheap trimmer does the job good love it
5/13/2019	Amazon	5	Shaver	Works really good
5/13/2019	Amazon	5	Awesome	The nose trimmer complete my life
5/14/2019	Amazon	5	Trimmer	Gives a great trimming!
5/14/2019	Amazon	5	I liks this product i would buy another one if i lose the two i have	I loved this clipper i bought one before but i burned the charger. So i had to buy another one for the charger and now i have two and they really good.
5/14/2019	Amazon	5	Great	Works well no complaints
5/15/2019	Amazon	5	Essential for the everyday mans grooming routine	Bought this because I hated buying razors so I tried this out and to be honest I really like it its so versatile and still works like it did the first day I bought it which was like maybe 2 and a half  years ago
5/15/2019	Amazon	3	"Not the battery, attachment clogged causeimg trimmer to slowly stop when on"	"I actually purchased mine from Walmart a few years ago. I was happy at first I just needed something to shave my whole face for work. The battery seemed to get weak after a few months like most people say about this product.  But (at least in my case) its not the battery its actually the attachment, Ive never cleaned it until recently (I didnt know hair could get in the attachment). I never used the goatee trimmer so I tried it earlier and there was no problem at all with battery life it was just the bigger clipper attachment was clogged or not oiled enough (making the trimmer come to a stop while still on).  I still wouldnt recommend this product but its not as cheap as some people think it is"
5/15/2019	Amazon	5	Super groomy	Leaves me less fuzzy
5/16/2019	Amazon	1	cut my skin	This groomer kept cutting my skin.
5/16/2019	Amazon	3	Spend a little extra	You get what you pay for. This razor is just ok. If you have a curly beard this razor is garbage. Spend a little extr for something nicer.
5/16/2019	Amazon	5	"Simply, handy, recommended"	Really easy to quickly trim you beard. Although it has various uses I mostly recommend it for trimming beard and body hair
5/17/2019	Amazon	5	Light and long lasting!!	Holds power for a long time and is very light.
5/17/2019	Amazon	4	Decent option with reasonable price	I am using it since last 6 months without any problem. Satisf6witj product. Very reasonably priced and worth it
5/18/2019	Amazon	1	Stopped holding a charge within a month	"I foolishly purchased two identical trimmers because I thought the first one was a dud. Sadly, they both suffered from the same fatal flaw: the battery simply cannot hold a sufficient charge. On the first one, I went through several normal charging cycles over a few months until it no longer allowed me to recharge. Then I bought a replacement only six weeks ago, and within a month it was unusable. To be clear, I can plug it in and charge it overnight, but the battery will still die before I complete the first shave. Both models thus proved utterly useless. Otherwise, it is a fine design for the price."
5/18/2019	Amazon	1	DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY	"Giving it 1 stars is more than it deserves. I bought this 2 months ago and now the trimmer cuts for 2 minutes then completly dies. Even on a full charge, you wont be able to shave your whole face without charging it again. Dont waste your time or money and look somewhere else"
5/18/2019	Amazon	5	Bang for your buck	Does exactly as advertised
5/19/2019	Amazon	5	Works great	"Easy to use, charge lasts long - shaves perfectly"
5/19/2019	Amazon	5	Works great as per my son	My son he loves it and would like me to buy him a spare one
5/19/2019	Amazon	1	Low quality	"If you enjoy cutting your face, bleeding and never knowing when you need to recharge, then this product is for you. I will go back and just buy Norelco shaver."
5/19/2019	Amazon	5	Excellent complement to a no bump shave kit.	Part one to a no bump shave kit and the Wahl Pro 5 Star Shaver/Shaper works hand and hand.
5/20/2019	Amazon	5	Works Great	"This little body groomer is pretty nice, it works well and the attachments are easy to swap from one to another."
5/20/2019	Amazon	1	Absolute Junk	"I purchased this item for the first time 2 years ago. I used it sparingly, as I am clean shaven for half of the year. I noticed that though the power supply didn't seem to fit properly into the shaving unit, it still did initially charge. After about a year, the power supply stopped working altogether and I couldn't charge the shaver. About 8 months later, I needed another shaver and made a mistake buying the same package again with the thought that I would have 2 shavers with the same charger and attachments, assuming that Remington by now had to have updated their power supply to actually fit in the shaving units properly... WRONG. It was still the same, ill-fitting charging unit. This time, the new shaving unit failed almost immediately, approximately 3 months. At 3 months it fails to hold a full charge no matter how long I charge the unit. It barely runs at all, and does not cut hair properly, and pulls the heck out of my facial hair. I cannot use it any longer. That said, I still have the shaving unit from my first purchase and that unit does still hold a charge enough to shave but is also failing and not cutting hairs cleanly, I feel the blades must be failing. So basically, I had to buy two packages to have one semi-functional beard trimmer. This is a case of you get what you pay for and, in retrospect, I wish I would have simply bought a better system to begin with. I should note that both were bought at Wal-Mart and I feel that Wal-Mart, an obvious junk seller since the 2000s, is really failing consumers with a new level of disposable junk. I have stopped buying most things at Wal-Mart as a result. Remington is now a brand that I find synonymous with  junk destined to line the landfills as opposed to a quality piece that will last for years of use. I found similar decline in the brand Black & Decker. These two companies seem to have relied on their name brand to facilitate the sale of absolute junk. These companies must not trust that the American consumer has any critical thinking ability or memory at all, because I have no idea who would go back to either company to buy anything after they've proven to irresponsibly pump out such junk. I know I will never buy from Remington again, regardless the cost, regardless their pitch, as they have lost all credibility to me."
5/20/2019	Amazon	1	Get Insurance! You'll definitely use it on this trimmer.	Just another disposable trimmer going in the trash. I trim my face every 5 days so maybe 6 times a month. After 3 months this trimmer barely holds a charge. This morning I had to finish trimming my face after my shower because it died just before finishing the job.  Nice work Remington.
5/20/2019	Amazon	5	Sus accesorios ayudan a completar el corte a la perfección.	"Buen producto, la calidad es justificable por su precio ya que es de plástico."
5/20/2019	Amazon	1	Terrible product	This is without question the worst product I've bought off of Amazon and even though not a product of Amazon they endorse the seller. Clippers don't even cut my facial hair at all fully charged.
5/21/2019	Amazon	5	Great for the money.	Works great.
5/21/2019	Amazon	5	Head to Trimming	"I liked all the attachments. Perfect for beards, goatees, mustaches, etc."
5/21/2019	Amazon	2	Terrible battery life	"So Ive only had to use this a handful of times. Roughly only 4-5 uses and its been sitting in my drawer for months. It finally needed to charge and guess what, this thing just wont hold a charge. Ive tried different outlets, charging devices and everything. It cant charge or hold a charge."
5/22/2019	Amazon	5	Amazing!	Best trimmers out there!!
5/22/2019	Amazon	5	Pretty darn great	My nose hair nightmare is now a thing of the past. 5/5.
5/23/2019	Amazon	5	Easy to use I like the many accessories	"So far so good, great price ,"
5/24/2019	Amazon	1	Died after 10-15 uses	"While the trimmer worked great at first, it died after 10-15 uses and will only run for about 30 seconds despite being plugged in. Left me with a half trimmed face the first time it happened."
5/24/2019	Amazon	5	Works like it should	Works like it should very happy
5/24/2019	Amazon	5	Very useful.	Love this product
5/25/2019	Amazon	5	Great gift for men	My fiance loved it
5/26/2019	Amazon	5	Variety	Product was as describe
5/26/2019	Amazon	2	It just stop work	"I like the trimer, but out of the blue it stop working and seem like it does not have enough power to keep the attachments working. Even after a full night charge. It just dies off and now I am stuck growing a beard"
5/26/2019	Amazon	5	Excelente producto	Muy bueno.
5/26/2019	Amazon	1	"Cheap, but not worth the money."	"Honestly, I picked this up based on Amazon reviews and I was severely disappointed. The heads are pretty low quality and it honestly doesn't cut well. Also, I prefer the spinning head for ear and nose trimming, the ones provided don't work well."
5/26/2019	Amazon	5	Good	Good
5/26/2019	Amazon	5	Buen producto	Buen producto
5/27/2019	Amazon	5	Works great	Money saver
5/27/2019	Amazon	1	Dont buy	Way to much tug and pull and the razor doesnt cut as close as I would like. I threw it out and used my old one
5/27/2019	Amazon	5	works great	i use it to straighten out my sideburns mostly. but i also use it if i haven't shaved for a week or more to keep my electric shaver from pulling out my hair
5/27/2019	Amazon	5	Still working after 2 years!	"Works well. Simple, no frills but effective for beard trimming and edge trimming."
5/27/2019	Amazon	5	Fantastic trimmer!	Fantastic little trimmer.  Great value. Works very well.  Battery lasts a long time in between charges.
5/28/2019	Amazon	5	Would recommend	Two years later it still works fine
5/28/2019	Amazon	5	Price	Good price for the product
5/28/2019	Amazon	1	Dont buy this product	Worst brand ever. It only lasted 3 months. I tried charging it and it wont turn on. I think the battery just dies
5/29/2019	Amazon	5	Great clippers	Great purchase Im very happy
5/29/2019	Amazon	5	Great value	Great product at a great price!
5/30/2019	Amazon	5	Good battery life	"I charge it one time, and i use it for 2 weeks before i need to charge it again. So certainly it has a good battery life."
5/30/2019	Amazon	1	Broke after a few months	This product stopped working after a few months. Something wrong with the motor I think. I really expected it to last longer. Buyer beware.
5/30/2019	Amazon	5	Get this one	Best of the offering
5/31/2019	Amazon	1	Wont last long	"I really liked the price of the item and how well it worked initially. However, I have only had it for a couple of months and now it wont even hold a charge for more than a minute. I didnt expect it to be high quality but I did expect it to last for at least a year..."
5/31/2019	Amazon	5	good item	the product it's great
5/31/2019	Amazon	2	"Plugged in, wouldnt turn on"	Never got a chance to use it cause I plugged it in and it never turned on.
5/31/2019	Amazon	5	Pleasantly surprised	"I had one of the Philips Norelco multigroomer more expensive models for years but it was damaged by baggage handling. This is less than half the price of that, but it feels just good as quality. A little sleeker and easier to handle actually. The parts take up less room due to a more elegant approach to interchangeable parts. I was excited to have the holder deck to keep things organized, but I overestimated how useful that would be. Unless you have plenty of counter space and want to display this in your bathroom, it will probably end up in a drawer like mine."
5/31/2019	Amazon	2	Broken in less than 6 months	Had the old model of this razor and j loved it! Worked great for me for several years. Purchased this new model and it has already stopped working after less than 6 months.
6/1/2019	Amazon	5	Light weight and its cordless!	"I love it, makes a bikini trim a snap"
6/2/2019	Amazon	4	Just as described	"A little flimsy, but for the price a good value!"
6/2/2019	Amazon	5	Great	Works great
6/2/2019	Amazon	5	Awesome men's grooming tool	"Really like this for all my hair trimming.  The battery life is awesome.  The portability is way easier than a cord.  This works great for body hair, facial hair and of course the head.  Great tool.  Great value"
6/2/2019	Amazon	5	Must have!	"Everything about this is amazing, its battery life is insane i think its died on me twice since ive bought it. Easy to use & works well. Can take it to go too!"
6/2/2019	Amazon	2	Junk	Failed after 1 year.
6/4/2019	Amazon	5	Is the good	Cuts good
6/5/2019	Amazon	1	terrible experience with this junk	"i bought within one year,only used as spare one,around 8 times,and died,won't recharged any more,"
6/6/2019	Amazon	1	Worked for a few months. Now it works for a minute or so before stopping.	"Very disappointed. It was working great when it did, I don't know why the hell it stopped."
6/6/2019	Amazon	1	Battery defunct after 10 months	"The trimmer works OK. I primarily used the small foil shaver to get into corners of my beard. But after 10 months of use, the battery wont stay charged. It runs for about 15 seconds and then goes dead."
6/6/2019	Amazon	5	Works exactly how I would expect!	"This is a great overall find. The variety of attachments allow trimming, full shave to '5-oclock shadow' and also other tools that can be used for nose, beard, hair, or anything else. The trimmer is strong and does a good job of cutting hair on a first pass. The battery is also quite nice. It lasts a very long time between charges, and I have yet to have it die while shaving. The stand isn't the greatest, but I put all of this in a drawer so that isn't a big deal to me."
6/6/2019	Amazon	5	good product and sharp	"it works just fine,thank you."
6/6/2019	Amazon	5	Good product	"Bought for my husband he loves it. Says it works well, good battery life."
6/7/2019	Amazon	5	5 stars	Great product for the price
6/8/2019	Amazon	5	"Simple, reliable and has all the features I need."	This works good for me.  I started growing a beard a few months back and picked this up to help me trim.  It's the only one I've tried and I don't need any more features.  Its reliable and the battery lasts a couple weeks before I need to recharge it.  That's using it every couple days.
6/8/2019	Amazon	4	Handy tool	Small. Easy to handle. Not much surface area for the microscreen shaver. The other attachments work well. Battery lasts a long time and is rechargeable. Worth the price.
6/9/2019	Amazon	4	.	Un poco pequeña
6/9/2019	Amazon	2	Shaving head broke	One of the shaving heads broke. Can I get a replacement.
6/9/2019	Amazon	3	Not making a clean trim	Not making a clean trim. Need to trim for 2 additional( total 3 time) to get a clean trim.
6/9/2019	Amazon	5	Buy It	My second product from Remington this is perfect to place on your bathroom table the all in one set has you cover no matter what personal grooming you need at a moments notice barely takes up any room and it's benefits are massive
6/10/2019	Amazon	5	Awesome buy!	Awesome product and I use all the different attachments it came with!
6/10/2019	Amazon	4	Decent trimmer	"It's good and does the job, however the beard attachment is super fragile and all the teeth on mine broke. It's ridiculous that you can't buy the parts separately and have to buy a new trimmer just because the plastic attachment broke!"
6/10/2019	Amazon	4	Gets the job done but not a ton of power	It works but I find myself going over the same spot a lot of times over again in order to trim it to a consistent length. So when it's done everything looks good but it seems to take longer than I am used to
6/10/2019	Amazon	5	"This is a great, cheap product"	The product was extremely helpful in removing hair EVERYWHERE
6/10/2019	Amazon	2	Not worth it.	"Not worth the money, just invest in something nicer and save yourself the money in the long run."
6/11/2019	Amazon	2	terrible battery!	"An otherwise decent product that is completely ruined by the insanely low quality battery.  This thing will not hold a charge.  Mine, after a full charge, won't even last a whole shave."
6/11/2019	Amazon	1	CANT RETURN IT.	"If you like it, perfect. If you dont , you CANT RETURN IT. Is plastic and doesnt have enough power to use it for body grooming. I will buy another one for a few more bucks."
6/11/2019	Amazon	4	Gets the job done	cheap and good battery life. simply does what its intended to do and nothing more
6/12/2019	Amazon	5	Great deal for quality!	Great deal for quality!
6/13/2019	Amazon	5	Easy to use.	Cuts and trims with precision.  Fits nicely in the hand.  Love using it.
6/15/2019	Amazon	5	Resurador	Excelente
6/15/2019	Amazon	3	Battery shorted after about a month	"It was alright, get what you pay for"
6/16/2019	Amazon	5	Great for the money	Have had it for a week and cut my hair with it and my face and it still has not needed a charge. And cut my brothers hair and face also
6/16/2019	Amazon	5	Gets the Job Done.	"I used this to shave off my hair completely and it worked like a charm. Nowadays it's used to trim my beard and a year later still working fine. The interchangeable heads are easy to swap out and function as intended. I cannot judge battery life longevity, as I use it only once a week or two and never leave the thing charging over night. It's yet to give me any issues."
6/16/2019	Amazon	5	Great value for money	Great Value for money

6/17/2019	Amazon	5	Hubby couldn't believe it didn't cost more	"Does a great job, assorted heads all work well, battery seems to stay charged well. Husband is very pleased with it, and likes it as much or more than the expensive one it replaced!"
6/18/2019	Amazon	4	CUTTERS	STILL USING
6/18/2019	Amazon	3	doesnt do the job	looks great but isnt worth it. doesnt shave properly and cuts the skin more than the hair. blades are very sharp to the skin and not aligned properly.  havent gotten the first shave from this thing yet.
6/19/2019	Amazon	5	Buen producto	Excelente
6/19/2019	Amazon	4	Thank you	good
6/19/2019	Amazon	5	Good buy	Bought it for my husband a couple month's ago! He loves it !!
6/19/2019	Amazon	5	Light weight	Easy to use
6/19/2019	Amazon	5	Hairy	Good for all hair needs.
6/19/2019	Amazon	5	Works great	Works great
6/20/2019	Amazon	5	Worth the money.	"The only thing I could possibly complain about, is that you cannot use this in the shower. Otherwise, worth the money spent on it.  Great work Remington."
6/20/2019	Amazon	5	Love it	"Long lasting battery, and it keeps the sharp for over 6 months"
6/20/2019	Amazon	4	Real bargain.	Very nice gift.
6/20/2019	Amazon	3	It's ok	You get what you pay for. Does not run for 65 minutes. It'll run for 20-25 max. Cannot tell when it'll be fully charge. (No charge indicator). It does trims well though
6/21/2019	Amazon	4	Good Enough	"This razor was a gift. The recipient was using the same old razor for too long. It was time for an upgrade. I got this because it had so many different attachments. I did notice the razor edge is significantly narrower than the old one. I am not sure if this affects the functionality of the product, but I was disappointed to see how much smaller it was than the older model."
6/21/2019	Amazon	5	Thank you	Love it
6/21/2019	Amazon	3	Im sure there are better products at this price point	Its just ok...
6/21/2019	Amazon	1	"DO NOT PURCHASE PRODUCT,,,DIED IN A MONTH....."	"Complete garbage....Just purchased product on May 19. Worked well for the first few weeks, then the battery stopped holding a charge. Now it won't run at all, and return date expired June 20....severely disappointed and would recommend buying something different. I've never had attempt to return a product from Amazon...they should defiantly look into this product and return there customers Money....."
6/22/2019	Amazon	5	Happy with purchase	Great shaver for the price.
6/23/2019	Amazon	2	Poor Quality	Poor quality item and needs more detailed information about each piece
6/23/2019	Amazon	5	Great product	My husband so happy with this product
6/23/2019	Amazon	3	Easy use for elderly	"After my elderly father got too sick to do some of his necessary grooming, I purchased this for my mother so she could take care of my father's needs. It was perfect for her to use on him. It made it so much easier for her."
6/23/2019	Amazon	1	Must be reconditioned or used.	"I've purchased several of these from retail stores that have all worked perfectly. From day one, I could have this thing plugged in all day to charge, but it would barely spin up and/or last more than 10 minutes. I'm not convinced it was brand new. I threw it out and bought one at Walmart, which works perfectly!"
6/24/2019	Amazon	3	Great Value for money	The trimmer as a stand alone itself works great but the attachments and other features don't cut the hair great at all. The adjustable clipper attachment is very delicate. Plastic on that broke on me within the first few weeks. Still a great value IMO.
6/24/2019	Amazon	1	Dull trimmer	"I've never had a trimmer pull so many hairs before. I'm not sure if the one I recieved is defective, but most painful beard trim I've ever had!"
6/24/2019	Amazon	5	Great product	Great clippers does just what I wanted on my beard. Other accessories are a bonus
6/24/2019	Amazon	1	Does not trim close like previous model.	"I have a previous model that is very similar. I used it for years to trim my beard and mustache. In certain places I trim the hair down to the skin, like under my nose. The unit (the battery?) is getting old so I got a new one that seems like the same Remington model only slightly updated. But it does not trim the mustache hair close to the skin like the old one. So I am disappointed. In the photo, the old one is on the right."
6/24/2019	Amazon	2	Like a sprinter with no hope of finishing a marathon.	"OK, there is no arguing this is a great trimmer for as long as it runs, which is no longer than 8 months of every other day use.  I have purchased three of these trimmers in the past some odd years and loved each one. But they don't last worth a darn and that really pisses me off.  Unfortunately, I am now in the market again for a trimmer and I can't bring myself to buy a fourth even at 20$ a pop."
6/24/2019	Amazon	4	Amazing but not perfect	Not really anything to complain about. It's not prefect but it works really well.
6/24/2019	Amazon	5	Great deal!!!	Great value! Can't beat it for the price!
6/25/2019	Amazon	5	Comes with travel bag.	They are great!
6/25/2019	Amazon	5	The battery lasts a really long time	It does his job. The battery is really strong.
6/25/2019	Amazon	5	Great	Awesome product
6/25/2019	Amazon	5	Trimmer	Great product
6/26/2019	Amazon	4	great as a gift or for yourself	have not had to recharge yet and I have had a month...
6/26/2019	Amazon	5	Works great	Good product great price but not sure about battery life as it hasnt been used much.
6/26/2019	Amazon	5	Great Value	Works Great
6/26/2019	Amazon	5	Handy	Purchase for my husband.  He likes it.
6/26/2019	Amazon	5	Battery life	This is the second time I bought this product to gift it to someone. Its amazing. Battery life is pretty good and does great work.
6/26/2019	Amazon	5	Solid trimmer	"I've had this trimmer for over two years now and it's still going strong. Use it to trim front, back, ""privates"", nose, and arms. Charges quickly and never had it die on me while in use. Also doesn't need oil very often which is a plus. Definitely would recommend if you're considering purchasing this for manscaping."
6/27/2019	Amazon	4	Good mens product to have	I like all the accessories that come with it. Small and compact so I can take it with me on travel.
6/27/2019	Amazon	5	Excellent value for the money	Love it don't have to charge it every time I use it
6/27/2019	Amazon	1	Stopped working after short time period	It broke

6/29/2019	Amazon	5	Easy to use	Great shaver gives a good shave
6/29/2019	Amazon	5	very versatile unit.	It works great. Rechargeable unit and all tools for different type of trimming.
6/29/2019	Amazon	3	God	God
6/30/2019	Amazon	1	Not a good buy as it looks	The interchangeable heads for the trimmer were very cheap and fell apart.
6/30/2019	Amazon	3	Ver la durabilidad	Es un poco pobre el el producto manejar con mucho cuidado porque lo podrías romper
6/30/2019	Amazon	4	"Not as good as previous model, but better battery."	"This is an updated version of a clipper that I used for years, but has some drawbacks. The stand does not hold the clipper well, and there is no cut out for the charge cord to be held in place while charging like the previous model did. It also does not come with the smaller clipper head that I used 90% of the time. Luckily the old one fits this also. I wanted something that would hold its accessories nicely on my countertop, and it does not. The clippers work well, but I liked my old one better."
6/30/2019	Amazon	4	works as needed	works as needed
6/30/2019	Amazon	5	Thumbs up	"Handy, travel size, dependable"
6/30/2019	Amazon	5	Works perfectly.	"I've had it for a about a year now and I've only charged it like 3 times. I only use it like once a month. Comes with 3 clip sizes, long charging cable, 2 other accessories that I dont know the names of and a nose trimmer all in a cool little bag."
7/1/2019	Amazon	5	excelent product	excelent product
7/1/2019	Amazon	5	Awesome Machine.	Love this. Every clip is very useful for me.
7/2/2019	Amazon	5	Great value	Great value for the money.  Works well and very handy.

7/2/2019	Amazon	3	Come In  Carry bag not a stand	Nice I like
7/3/2019	Amazon	5	Highly recommend!!	Very good quality for the price!!
7/3/2019	Amazon	5	Just as advertised	Everything about this product is just like it says. Very close shave.
7/3/2019	Amazon	5	For the price works good enough.	Good for the price.
7/4/2019	Amazon	5	Impressive precision and battery	This product provides amazing sharp precise cuts over anything I have used before
7/4/2019	Amazon	5	Works as you would want it to	Great tool. Well made. Great value
7/4/2019	Amazon	5	Remington body groomer	"The Remington body groomer is a lightweight, easy to use body groomer.  I'm happy with the different attachments, the length of time that the battery lasts, and the results after grooming."
7/4/2019	Amazon	1	Mediocre product.	This product is garbage. The battery life is poor and it stopped working after less 3 months
7/5/2019	Amazon	5	For my husband	"Husband loves it, 2nd one"
7/5/2019	Amazon	2	It's alright	I don't like the battery life and how it cuts. Seems the blade is not sharp. Should of went with another model.
7/5/2019	Amazon	5	Exactly what I need	"I wanted to upgrade from my battery operated trimmer to one that was rechargeable but I didn't want to spend a bunch of money. If you need a simple trimmer without spending a lot, then this would be perfect you."

7/5/2019	Amazon	4	Alright	Ok for the money
7/6/2019	Amazon	5	Great value	This is my second one. The first one was still in working order but I misplace one of the heads.
7/6/2019	Amazon	3	Not up to my expectation	I was expecting a better product but little disappointed. I am used to Philips and decided to give this a try. Extension to trim body hair and also extension to trim nose hair is absolutely terrible. Ended up buying another product and looks like this is going to be waste.
7/6/2019	Amazon	1	Doesn't trim well.	Weak motor
7/6/2019	Amazon	4	Works well	"Does great for the price, but nothing grand"
7/7/2019	Amazon	2	Trouble with quality	The roller attachment broke the first time I used it
7/7/2019	Amazon	5	Perfect!	Love it very much! works great.

7/9/2019	Amazon	5	Perfect	Bought as a gift for my son
7/9/2019	Amazon	5	Gift	This was a gift for my boyfriend.
7/10/2019	Amazon	2	Only lasted 1 year	Clippers worked great for a year and then died
7/10/2019	Amazon	5	All in one	Works really good
7/10/2019	Amazon	5	It cuts hair	Charged full when I received it. Shaved my 3 inch long beard and been keeping the stubble by trimming. It works. Also great for shaving my head. Prefer one of these small trimmers as opposed to the big machines. Used it 6 times and haven't had to charge it yet.
7/10/2019	Amazon	4	Nice gifts for him	He loves his gifts .. thank you!
7/10/2019	Amazon	5	Grat Grooming Kit	I love the many attachments and ease of use
7/10/2019	Amazon	5	"Looks good, feels good"	"Great trimmer with a good amount of customization for different lengths of hair. And, it looks really cool!"
7/10/2019	Amazon	5	Best cheap one	Great for quick sieving.
7/11/2019	Amazon	4	Excelente inversión	"En realidad le he dado poco uso, pero es excelente en todos los aspectos"
7/11/2019	Amazon	5	Great price for a great product.	"Ive had this for nearly a year now. I honestly didnt expect it to last, but its still going strong! Firstly, it holds a charge for what seems like a couple weeks before charging it again. (I use it every other day.) All of the different attachments are great and do their intended purposes. No problems with these, they are all durable and show no sign of any wear. The blades still cut like the first day I tried it out! Overall a great product."
7/11/2019	Amazon	5	Reliable and lasts long	I love this little set. It's been very reliable. I've had it since 2017 and here it is 2 years later and it's still getting the job done. I'm about to order another one bcuz I somehow misplaced the charging cord. I wish I could just buy the charger separately tho ??
7/11/2019	Amazon	1	JUNK	"This trimmmer BLOWS. If your beard is even close to coarse... FORGET ABOUT IT. Pulling, tugging nighmare."

7/11/2019	Amazon	5	Very good trimmer	Feels good in my hand
7/12/2019	Amazon	5	BEST MENS FULL BODY GROOMER!!!!	Very pleased with this product.  Very gentle.  You wont knick or hurt your boys if you know what I mean.  I absolutely love that it will NOT accidentally turn on in your travel bag & run itself DEAD like most others.
7/12/2019	Amazon	1	Stopped Charging After 2 Months	"Ive only charged this trimmer a few times, but it stopped charging within the first two months. The light wont even turn on. Ive tried multiple outlets made sure I was charging it when it was switched off. A total waste of money."
7/12/2019	Amazon	5	Buena calidad	Bien
7/12/2019	Amazon	5	.	Great for bald dudes
7/12/2019	Amazon	5	Detail trimmer especially around mouth area.	Excellent product. Easy to handle and trims perfectly. Love it.
7/13/2019	Amazon	2	Stopped working	Product really dose its job but after about 3 months It just stop working!
7/14/2019	Amazon	1	Fancy but no value for money	The charger stopped working after first charge and the device seems useless now.
7/14/2019	Amazon	5	"Good value, recommended"	This is the only electric trimmer I have ever owned.  It works well.  I recommend it.
7/14/2019	Amazon	5	Well worth it	"It's one of the best I've had yet my wife and I use it as a landscaping tool wink, wink if ya get what i mean and hands down the best"
7/14/2019	Amazon	5	Great for the money.	For an inexpensive trimmer I am really happy with it no issue with over a year of use.
7/14/2019	Amazon	4	Shaver	Nice works greatv
7/14/2019	Amazon	5	Perfect clippers !!!	"I bought these for my husband and they have been the best clippers ever, I will definitely be purchasing more for gifts to give for the holidays."
7/14/2019	Amazon	5	As Described	As Described
7/14/2019	Amazon	1	Charging problem	"The machine worked perfectly. but now, 5 months later, I cant change it anymore..."
7/15/2019	Amazon	4	Size it's good	Everything good
7/15/2019	Amazon	4	Won't cut you.	Takes multiple passes but won't cut you. Its a comprise. You choose...
7/16/2019	Amazon	5	My client is happy	"My client is happy with this device, that there is versatility and comfort"
7/16/2019	Amazon	5	No man should be without it!	"This little trimmer is fantastic. I have always have my husband and boys haircuts and I use this to shave the back of neck and trim around the ears. They use it for their breads and mustaches....comes with a nice selection of grooming tools including a nose and dad hair removal tool.  My son just moved out and he borrowed it and didn't bring it back (if they keep it for so long it becomes theirs,lol) anyway I just bought another one!"
7/16/2019	Amazon	4	Good	Good
7/17/2019	Amazon	3	Cheaply made.	Cheaply made. But you get what you pay for. Hard to parts to stay on stand. Easily fall out.
7/17/2019	Amazon	3	Cheaply made.	Cheaply made. But you get what you pay for. Hard to parts to stay on stand. Easily fall out.
7/17/2019	Amazon	3	not really worth it	It is a really weak shaver. Not strong or sturdy enough to think that it will last me more than a year or so or be used every month maximum. I would rather buy something that can effectively do the job and not have low battery or weak shaving power.
7/17/2019	Amazon	5	THE PERSONAL GROOMER	Definitely would like another one. The price is excellent and the value is the same. I want a extra one.

7/17/2019	Amazon	5	Good price	"Exscellent product, good battery and amazing quality"
7/18/2019	Amazon	5	Love it	This is my 3rd one. Love it.
7/18/2019	Amazon	5	Nice rechargeable trimmer!	Great Deal. I needed a man trimmer for when Im on the road. Nice portable size and is working great. Hopefully it will last a while.
7/18/2019	Amazon	1	Philips better used both	Turns hot while trimming. I had a philips one before but misplaced it so bought this one. There is a huge difference in feel and clear trim between both. Trying to return it. Disappointed
7/18/2019	Amazon	5	Great for the husband	Husband loves the ease of using this for trimming his beard
7/18/2019	Amazon	1	Seems to have battery problems	"Mine came with a dead battery, it won't charge and won't run but the small charging light illuminates. It is a very nice color of green but that alone doesn't seem worth the $30."
7/19/2019	Amazon	5	does the job	you can't expect this product to perform like a high end expensive clipper. but for its price it's the best I've come across
7/19/2019	Amazon	5	Battery life is short	"Great trimmer , had all the accessories you needed. But battery life is bad . Battery failed to charged after a few months of usage."
7/19/2019	Amazon	5	Fantasty	Fantasty
7/20/2019	Amazon	1	Poor Packaging Lead to Broken Tooth on Attachment	All of the blades attachments were loose in their bags!  The bags were emptied and the attachments left flopping around in the packages bottom case.  A tooth end on one attachment even broke off.  The package for the razor didnt appear to be sealed on the lower left like all the other edges/seams
7/20/2019	Amazon	5	Great buy	Long battery life and smooth cuts.
7/20/2019	Amazon	5	A true win for the price	"I bought this trimmer about 2 years ago and I have been extremely satisfied with the purchase. This is probably the best trimmer I have ever had and it was a great price for what you get. I used this to trim my hair and beard mainly, but it is suitable for any purposes with the attachments included. After using it frequently for this long, it has never had any battery or blade issues. The blades are still sharp and can easily cut. 10 pieces in the box and they can easily be organized with the organizer included. There is still no issues with it. I have included some pictures to help.  There is only one thing that I did not like about this. The battery light is not supposed to turn green or turn off when fully charged. I had to call them to make sure about this and their agent told me that it is totally fine and it wont change the color at all. Anyway, awesome for the price."
7/20/2019	Amazon	1	Battery did not hold charge after a few months	"Now in the garbage bin, stopped working after a short period of time.  Don't waste your money on this Remington shaver."

7/20/2019	Amazon	1	Opened and used before . Not trusted seller	"I saw blonde hair inside and all the small pieces used and out of wrap Disgusting, dont buy it it will give you disease. Amazon didnt refund the price obviously with an extra one dollar !!!(I dont have anything to say)"
7/21/2019	Amazon	5	Great shaver	Works great everywhere face and body.
7/21/2019	Amazon	5	Great shaver	Works great everywhere face and body.
7/21/2019	Amazon	3	I would go for the Norelco with the sliding wheel for more precision in the length adjustments	"I bought this.  It works fine.  However, the shortest comb is 3mm and I like to trim to about 2mm.  So I would recommend the Norelco product that I bought shortly after buying this one that has a sliding wheel to adjust to all sorts of short lengths."
7/21/2019	Amazon	4	Missing an piece but double of any other piece	Over all great value and everything works well but I took off a star because they sent two of the Nose/ear trimmer and not a foil trimmer. And its not like they can do anything about it thats an error on actually Remington. But that fool one is for closer shaving and if you think thatll be useful I dont know if youd want to risk buying it and it not being there.
7/21/2019	Amazon	3	There are better alternatives	"Overheats easily. Too noisy for me. Does the job well. My brother has the Phillips alternative to this clipper, and works and feels much better, and I think it's even cheaper."
7/21/2019	Amazon	4	Works for small dog!	I bought this for my toy poodle! It works great until the battery was acting up... it was okay. I only suggested for using this for small dog with less coat (hair). Because that shaver is pretty small and the battery doesnt last that long. Its depend how long you will take
7/22/2019	Amazon	1	Not charging	Well worked untill charge run out and then It stopped charging. Waste of money
7/22/2019	Amazon	3	Decent chargeable shaver.	Decent and use it when I don't use a razor shaving my head.
7/22/2019	Amazon	5	You won't be disappointed	Love it!!
7/22/2019	Amazon	5	Nice groomer	"Excellent product, battery life is going on 4 months after 1st charge"
7/23/2019	Amazon	5	Great value for need.	Used to trim facial hair.
7/23/2019	Amazon	5	Exelente	Muy buena
7/23/2019	Amazon	2	Great Idea - Poor Battery	"I didn't purchase through Amazon, but nevertheless, the battery doesn't hold a charge very well. The first charge was great, but now I am not getting a week's use out of it."
7/23/2019	Amazon	1	Died after 18 months	Was a good trimmer until it quit holding a charge and now died completely.
7/23/2019	Amazon	3	Razor	Does not shave facial hair as well.
7/23/2019	Amazon	5	Not bad	Cheap option for manscaping.
7/24/2019	Amazon	5	Wonderful gift	Last minute father's day gift. Wonderful. No other words describe it. Everything about this device is absolutely wonderful
7/24/2019	Amazon	5	Wonderful gift	Last minute father's day gift. Wonderful. No other words describe it. Everything about this device is absolutely wonderful
7/24/2019	Amazon	5	Work is wery well?? nice products	It is a very well
7/25/2019	Amazon	3	Use	Not as good as I hoped for
7/25/2019	Amazon	1	Shaver stopped working	checked power: OK....checked again double checked...just stopped working....time to throw away and get a quality shaver.  Buyers problem: too cheap!  I confess I thought I would get a quality shaver at a cheap price.  I was wrong.
7/25/2019	Amazon	5	easy	the best one
7/25/2019	Amazon	5	Comfortable in hands	Love it
7/25/2019	Amazon	1	Horrible battery charge	"Battery life barely lasted more than one charge. After a few uses, charge would not last."
7/26/2019	Amazon	5	Good for downstairs trims	"I use it to trim but not my beard. it works well and doesnt cut often you but it will if youre not careful. battery life is fine, i dont use it everyday though. for how cheap it was i would get another one when this one goes out."
7/26/2019	Amazon	1	Garbage	Worked for a week.
7/26/2019	Amazon	1	"Very disappointing, worked great and then stopped..."	"Worked amazing for about 3 months.... All of a sudden its useless and wont turn on.  Was not dropped or damaged.  Placed it on charger for an hour when it ran dead and never charged back up, even when left over night."
7/27/2019	Amazon	1	the 6020 has terrible battery life	"much like other users I encountered the bad battery life problem with the 6020 almost immediately, which has frustrated me using the device. I end up charging for 24 hours to get maybe 10 minutes of half-powered energy."
7/27/2019	Amazon	5	Works perfect	Good item
7/27/2019	Amazon	1	Broke after three uses	This trimmer would not charge after my third time using.  Please do not buy this product.
7/28/2019	Amazon	5	Perfect for trimming beard and mustache!!	I bought this for my 18 y/o son to use to trim his beard and mustache. He seems to like it a lot. The attachments are easy to exchange out and work well. All in all a very good trimmer on a budget!!
7/28/2019	Amazon	4	Handy	Very good with the upgraded battery
7/28/2019	Amazon	5	Worth it 100%	Works great and no pulling hairs
7/28/2019	Amazon	1	I was only able to use this once before it decided to not work...	"As the title states, I got one use out of it before it stopped working. I would stay away from this product personally."
7/29/2019	Amazon	5	Awesome trimmer	Great quality
7/29/2019	Amazon	5	Buen producto	Buen producto
7/29/2019	Amazon	4	Does well for its size	As a body shaver it been very good at not pulling hairs and cutting cleanly.
7/29/2019	Amazon	5	Accidental Success	Initially bought these to be my travel shaving kit but ultimately gave it a go with manscaping and was blown away with the quality and safety of these blades.  I'd recommend for anyone wanting to shape up without the fear of pain!
7/29/2019	Amazon	5	Durable and versatile	Have used for several weeks and have not needed to recharge the battery. The foil attachment is better than other trimmers I have used and their is more than enough options and sizes for any type of shave.
7/29/2019	Amazon	5	Good product	Good product
7/29/2019	Amazon	5	Convenient attachments. Good value	Works well. Lots of convenient attachment
7/30/2019	Amazon	5	Works excellent	Works excellent
7/30/2019	Amazon	5	You can wash the detachable pieces just not the reason.	It works good. You get a lot for what you pay. All around great purchase.
7/30/2019	Amazon	4	Kind of good	"The body comb does the job perfectly, the other accessories not so much, they aren't effective at all, and sometimes I have to use the razor anyway."
7/30/2019	Amazon	5	Battery last forever	"This is just overall a really good purchase. Ive had it for like 7 months now and Ive charged it maybe 5 times. The battery is really good and holds on to the charge really well also. As far as functionality, this thing has everything that I need. I have a relatively patchy thick hairs beard( I know, weird). But it definitely gets the job done."
7/31/2019	Amazon	5	It works	Good product
7/31/2019	Amazon	5	Stand is loose	Dope product. Only the stand isn't that good. Things on it too loose
7/31/2019	Amazon	5	review	"nice trimmer, holder could be better built items seem to fall out"
7/31/2019	Amazon	4	You get what you pay for.	You get what you pay for.
7/31/2019	Amazon	1	only worked a month	They must be having battery problems. Only worked a month. I properly charged and maintained but stopped taking a charge after a month and a half.
7/31/2019	Amazon	5	Awesome product	Comes with all the necessary tools to give my boyfriend a hair cut every month! Have to charge battery to full after each use
7/31/2019	Amazon	4	"powerfull and comfortable, lots of features"	"great trimmer, best value for money. should have sold with a case or a small bag for all the small pieces."
8/1/2019	Amazon	4	Nice piece	Works great !!
8/1/2019	Amazon	5	Good quality	My husband loves it
8/2/2019	Amazon	5	Good value	I'm really satisfied with this product it's better than anything I had before
8/2/2019	Amazon	3	Not a complete product	"The unit didn't come with all the attachments listed in the instruction and care pamphlet.  Of course, the two pieces I actually needed (reason for the purchase) are the ones that failed to make it in the box.  Very disappointed, considering this is a name brand product.  At this point, it doesn't matter how well it works, because I can't use it as it was intended."
8/2/2019	Amazon	1	Don't do it.	"This is my second try with this trimmer (yes 1 died and i bought another). If you have a beard/body hair, this isn't for you.  The battery and mechanics die within 2 months. You charge for 6 hours and get 5 minutes of work, the rest is tugging your hair out. If you want patches left behind, this is your product."
8/4/2019	Amazon	5	working great	i seen some bad and good  on it  all i ll say so far it works great and the price was great  it works does the job
8/4/2019	Amazon	1	Poor Battery.	Battery wouldn't hold a charge after 3 months.
8/4/2019	Amazon	4	Easy to use	I like so far as easy to use and the charges lasts a long time.
8/4/2019	Amazon	2	Price seems to reflect quality.	The price was good. Unfortunately the attachments are flimsy and feel cheap and it's actually more awkward to use than my older trimmer. Battery life is quite good however.
8/4/2019	Amazon	5	Love it	Love it
8/5/2019	Amazon	5	Clean shave	I dont shave everyday and the battery will last for atleast 1 to 2 months and always has a good clean shave.
8/5/2019	Amazon	5	5/5 stars. i'm pretty impressed and it's smooth running across my skin as well.	5/5 stars. i'm pretty impressed and it's smooth running across my skin as well.
8/5/2019	Amazon	1	"As others said, does quickly"	"I was very happy with it for 2 months but then it stopped working. The blades don even trim properly now, buying philips or something else which is expensive but worth it. If you buy this, get insurance."
8/5/2019	Amazon	5	Good value	Great little trimmer for manscapeing.
8/5/2019	Amazon	5	As described......	"Works great, no complaints! Well made and a good value!!!"
8/5/2019	Amazon	2	cheap but not durable	it has been a little bit more than 3 weeks now but it has already started losing shaving power. i don't recommend it.
8/5/2019	Amazon	5	Recommend	It's okay
8/5/2019	Amazon	5	Great	Great
8/6/2019	Amazon	5	"""Well worth the money"""	"Just got this today so I can't say anything about the battery life. I can however speak about how nice this thing cuts and all the attachments it provides to you for whatever style you wear your facial hair and even manscaping. I loved my old one but since I've had to replace that one, this one is a much better peice."
8/6/2019	Amazon	4	Not bad at all ??	I would buy again
8/6/2019	Amazon	1	mal servicio	se devolvio autorizaron el desembolso han pasado varios dia y no ponen el dinero en mi tarjeta y he escrito por otrs vias y nada
8/6/2019	Amazon	5	Value	Lasted 20 months still works but doesn't cut well. Worth the $20.00 spent.
8/6/2019	Amazon	2	The cut was unimpressive	"I wanted to use it to keep my hairline clean and tight, but the blades have no precision so I couldn't create a line for my hair or beard."
8/6/2019	Amazon	5	10 years!	My first one lasted for 10 years.  It was one of the first trimmer I bought in my life.  I bought a con-air and it died after a year.  This one just kept on going.  I'm hoping my replacement last at least half as long as my first one.
8/6/2019	Amazon	1	Not worth it	Used this once and it cut my skin and caused me to bleed. Had guard on and everything. Never using it again. Should have paid more for the nicer ones.
8/7/2019	Amazon	1	Battery quality terrible	"Terrible razor, battery died out. Only got one full charge and the battery inside the razor isnt not charging"
8/7/2019	Amazon	5	"I want to be sure, very good!"	"I want to be sure, very good!"
8/7/2019	Amazon	5	I used this to cut both facial and head hair.	"So I bought this about 2 years or so ago to helps with my face shaving, as I shave once a week (I hate facial hair but hate shaving at the same time, yes Im difficult) so I would let me facial hair grow out use this to lower the hair then shave with my safety razor. Works like a charm really, was quick and didnt pull hair. I also used it to cut my head hair. I typically buzz cut my hair so I used this little guy and it does the trick, yes it is smaller and thus takes a little more time but really does the charm. Sadly I just had to throw mine away due to the head deciding that it doesnt want to cut hair anymore but more rip the hair out. Definitely would buy it again."
8/8/2019	Amazon	5	Ladies this is for you too!	"I was skeptical about this, but if you need ANYTHING ???? shaved on your entire body quickly, this is the razor.  Doesnt hurt out of the box anywhere on the body.  Smooth and precise.  Where has this been all my life!  Wow!!  Buy buy buy ladies.  Very quick.  Was entirely shaved (groomed) in 2 minutes!!"
8/8/2019	Amazon	5	Great product	Second one Ive bought.
8/8/2019	Amazon	5	Wireless	All what i expected
8/8/2019	Amazon	1	The battery doesn't last too long	Junk
8/9/2019	Amazon	4	Awesome	"Awesome trimmer, wish it was just a little quieter like my full size hair clippers but none the less great device."
8/9/2019	Amazon	3	Not impressed	"I have been cutting both my husband's and son's hair for years now and used to use the Norelco trimmer for trimming their neck and side burns but it has seen better days.  That's why I started looking for a new model and came across this one.  However, after trying what I thought was a well known brand name, I wish I would've tried buying another Norelco.  It doesn't cut very well and is loud, my husband doesn't even like it for trimming his beard.  It doesn't cut like the other one.  In fact, I bought this 6 months ago and have maybe used it twice.  Not impressed, sorry."
8/10/2019	Amazon	1	Battery lasted only one year	"The battery lasted only for a year, now with a full charge battery lasts for about 10 seconds....its not a typo 10 seconds. This thing cannot be used while plugged in so and it is not worth the effort to change the battery. I am very satisfied with my Remington Shaver, I have for years but this is a disappointment."
8/10/2019	Amazon	5	Recommend	Good value for the money. Works well and does a good job.
8/11/2019	Amazon	5	"Nice product, works great, sharp blades, I highly recommend!"	"Five stars! Great for what we need it for, I would definitely recommend it! The price is nice! Nice little holder with it, we keep it in the drawer but if you didnt want to it would look nice on your vanity! Came in a nice bag, we really like it!"
8/11/2019	Amazon	1	Died right after return window closed	"I have used the razor 4 times and it is dead. Shows it is charging but won't come on but for about 2 seconds. My return period just expired. It's a shame, my old remingtons lasted several years."
8/11/2019	Amazon	1	Useless	"This trimmer is useless. The different trimmer sizes don't work. I can grow out my beard for a month and this POS still won't trim anything with the sizer 3 mm. The older trimmer I had was great, it actually trimmed to the level I wanted. But for this, I have to use the 1mm sizer, which essentially is taking off everything. Defeats the purpose of a trimmer with the different sizers. DO NOT BUY"
8/12/2019	Amazon	3	"Bad battery, breaks quick, but handles well and affordable"	"This is my third set and Im already having battery issues after fully charged. It doesnt last too long, its been just a few weeks with barely any use and its dead, which luckily isnt too big a deal bc it recharges, obviously, so Ive learned to charge it every week or so. I use it for about 2 minutes twice a week, so not really any excuse for the poor battery life. The other two went bad each around the one year mark, with the trimmer blades developing cutting issues and re-oiling/cleaning ineffective in spite of incessant  immaculate upkeep. The plastic adjustable-level-piece is less than inadequate with teeth one by one breaking off after just normal use, starting around 6 months, and nearly toothless by the time the blades start having issues at 12months. BUT, its very small and cuts well enough for haircuts for 3 people plus regularly trimming beards. It extremely versatile for super close (barely a five oclock shadow) to as long as you need. It is exceptionally smooth on the skin, with no knicks or cuts like most bigger ones incur. I can press pretty hard into my face with the bare blade to get a nearly clean shave fast and it shapes around the ears with ease. Plus it handles well with its form fitting shape (like an hour glass) and small size for maneuvering, so its super easy to grip. And thats the best part versus all the others Ive ever had: quality of trim/cut and handling. So in spite of the short battery and blade life, its not too bad to fork over this cost once a year considering how expensive it would be to pay a barber as often as I want a trim."
8/12/2019	Amazon	1	Not worth the money...	The first few uses were  good.  Then down hill from there. This trimmer will Not hold a charge.... Disappointing...
8/12/2019	Amazon	2	Not sturdy and not convenient to use	I generally like quality but this item does not have; not sturdy and not convenient to use hence returning this item.
8/12/2019	Amazon	5	Works well.	Really like it. Works well. Doesn't pull hairs.
8/13/2019	Amazon	3	Guard broke super easily	"This was great for a while, then nearly all of the teeth of the guard comb broke off in a short space of time making it pretty much unusable for trimming"
8/13/2019	Amazon	1	no stars	bought it in may and it already is not working at al
8/13/2019	Amazon	3	Nose hair trimming attachment was useless	The nose hair trimmer attachment was useless

8/16/2019	Amazon	4	very dependable	does great job on a tuff beard
8/16/2019	Amazon	5	Awesome set of clippers	Great clippers.  Head design keeps hair and water out of motor enclosure.  Easy to change heads and clean.
8/16/2019	Amazon	2	Battery died after a year	"Used it to trim my mustache and beard, and I guess it lasted longer than the others that were reviewed. But still a disappointment; thought it will last a few years Did the job though although the nose trimmer needs to be improved.."
8/16/2019	Amazon	5	Works great	Husband has used it twice so far and it works good.
8/17/2019	Amazon	5	As advertised. Does a great job. Thanks!	As advertised. Does a great job. Thanks!
8/17/2019	Amazon	1	More use as a paperweight.	"Absolutely terrible, had since April 2019 its now August 2019 and does not work. Only used once a week in that time. Would not recommend."
8/17/2019	Amazon	3	Hairs in blade	"Just got my ""brand new"" trimmer in the mail, and the package was opened and there was small hairs inside the blades! Pretty gross"
8/17/2019	Amazon	5	Descent	Very nice and decent product.  Amazing service related to product by Remington.
8/17/2019	Amazon	5	Bf loves it	The bf loves it and says that it works great so five stars ??
8/18/2019	Amazon	1	Garbage.	garbage do not buy. Barely trims or cuts hair.
8/18/2019	Amazon	1	Shaver does not shave properly	"We usually don't write reports, but we had to write this one. We bought the shaver to shave our 5 yr old son's head. But the shaver doesn't shave properly! It stops working all the time and pulls out hairs. Very painful for our poor son.  NEVER. AGAIN. Sorry to say, but not recommended to anyone. No idea how this got rated 4 stars."
8/18/2019	Amazon	1	Sucked	Batteries don't charge after 2 uses! Complete POS!
8/19/2019	Amazon	5	Amazing	"Cheap, but high quality and high use. I've been using this for about a month now and I've almost completely stopped using bladed razers."
8/19/2019	Amazon	4	My go to brand	"Remington is our go to brand for facial shavers, always has been. Each one normally lasts around a year, we are used to it. During that year, they work great. This one has been great so far! Different model than the one we normally get, so maybe we will get a longer life from it. I chose this model because it has the ""body shaver attachment"" on it. Best part. My only complaint is that the attachments nor the shaver will stay on the stand that it comes with. Just falls right off. Not a deal breaker by any means though. I don't really care about the stand and normally keep the shavers in a small basket that matches the bathroom counter decor."
8/19/2019	Amazon	5	Good quality	Good quality
8/19/2019	Amazon	5	"Muy práctico, de uso diario"	"Ya tenía uno de baterías reemplazables. Comprado hace varios años, este está mucho mejor y le quedan los mismos accesorios"
8/20/2019	Amazon	5	They deliver as promised.	Product arrived on time as promised. Very happy.
8/20/2019	Amazon	4	Worked Well	"Bought this for the times I would noy be able to get to the barber. It worked better than I expected Great product, worth the price."
8/20/2019	Amazon	4	works great	"I read alot of reviews before I bought this trimmer, mostly all the negative reviews were about the battery.  I haven't had any problems, plenty of battery, I got 10 yrs. out of my last remington thats why I bought this one. For the price 1 year would make me happy."
8/20/2019	Amazon	5	Top tier shaver	Really nice shaver for money Easy to recharge. Cuts very smoothly.
8/20/2019	Amazon	5	Great value!	The trimmer works great for facial hair trimming
8/21/2019	Amazon	4	Works well	So far so good
8/21/2019	Amazon	5	Good product	It is a good product and able to get close shave and battery life is good.
8/21/2019	Amazon	5	Calidad	"Buen producto, buena calidad, es muy útil"
8/21/2019	Amazon	5	Best Product	Great product to use. Fine cuts and many modes available.
8/22/2019	Amazon	5	Exactly What I Was Looking For	"I bought this to trim my bikini area. All of the lady versions looks like cheap pieces of junk and had very few reviews which I dont trust. I read one review that said to not bother and to just buy a mans mustache trimmer instead. I found this one, It was the right price with plenty of great reviews. I got it last night and it was already charged so I could try it out. It trimmed perfectly and comfortably and the foil attachment is a close yet soft shape it was the right price with plenty of great reviews. I got it last night and it was already charged so I could try it out. It trimmed perfectly and comfortably and the foil attachment is a close yet soft shave. I have really sensitive skin so a razor or waxing just irritates my skin and leaves red bumps. This will be perfect for keeping me trimmed up nice while on a beach vacation! I am constantly dumbfounded at how the products marketed towards a female who is essentially using it for the same purpose as a man cant get something made of the same quality (but its pink!). I dont need a razor thats pink or purple I just need a razor that is made well, does the job its designed to do,  and is a decent price."
8/22/2019	Amazon	5	Amazing	Even more attachments than I thought existed. Extremely good for multipurpose grooming.
8/22/2019	Amazon	5	TRIMMER	EXCELENTE
8/23/2019	Amazon	4	I love this little thing.	It makes hair go away. I can put it up to my balls without feeling scared for my life. It works.
8/23/2019	Amazon	5	??	??
8/23/2019	Amazon	5	They work and for the price I bought them will buy again from Amazon if needed again	Bought them for my boyfriend he loves it
8/23/2019	Amazon	1	Cant use while charging	"Its garbage, the battery can only be charged while NOT using it so if youre traveling you have to wait for it to charge. The shaver is about 5/8 wide so while yes it is a shaver its about have the size of a normal shaver and therefore takes twice as long. Im going back to a shaver and clippers for my facial hair needs."
8/24/2019	Amazon	1	Battery doesnt last more than a year.  Not replaceable.	"Sadly, the same battery failure happened to me as many other reviewers.  I had this razor for just over a year, with very little use and always keeping the battery charged and maintained.  Its completely dead now and wont charge at all.  I understand it was only $20, but I expected it to last longer than just a year with occasional use.  Try your luck with another brand or model than this one."
8/24/2019	Amazon	1	Stopped working 4 days after returnable	Stopped working 4 days after returnable
8/24/2019	Amazon	4	Does what it's meant to do.	Reliable and quick and easy to use.
8/24/2019	Amazon	1	Battery DIED in 3 months	"I was really enjoying using this trimmer as it was smooth and precise. However, the rechargeable battery died in July, barely 2 and a half months after using. I used it once a week and probably charged it twice. I am extremely disappointed with this product. I would like to be recompensated for this faulty trimmer.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
8/24/2019	Amazon	5	Great set of trimmers	Great trimmers for the money. Battery life is fantastic.
8/24/2019	Amazon	1	Useless	"Good razor for extremely limited use. Attachments are junk, specifically the foil and nose attachments. Huge disappointment."

8/25/2019	Amazon	1	So Very Bad	"Doesn't hold charge, slow blade speed, dull, not functional. Ew."
8/25/2019	Amazon	2	Not value for money	"All those attachment which comes with the trimmer are irritating as it makes it hard for me to adjust the size. Also, the quality is not that good."
8/25/2019	Amazon	5	??	??
8/26/2019	Amazon	1	Keep looking	Worked great. Suddenly died 9 months old. So disappointed. Wont charge. Nothing.
8/26/2019	Amazon	5	Nice Trimmer	"This is a very nice trimmer. It is slim and easy to handle. It trims close so that there is no stubble. Very nice for mustache and trimming around the nose. Plenty of power, seems to stay charged more than a week."
8/26/2019	Amazon	4	Buy it!	Nice razor!
8/26/2019	Amazon	1	Dont buy	Battery wouldnt hold a charge after 2 weeks. Buy something else
8/26/2019	Amazon	5	Buen producto	Practico y muy útil. Lo único es mientras está cargando no se puede utilizar.
8/26/2019	Amazon	1	Guaranteed to (NOT) Trim & Detail Better	"I bought this to replace a Philips NORELCO G370 which lasted over a decade of use.  This Remington product boasted that it would trim and detail better.  Instead, it was far worse.  I suppose if I had been willing to spend an hour or so having it gum at my beard it might have worked, but my Philips NORELCO was far better and quicker.  I just wish my old model was still manufactured."
8/27/2019	Amazon	5	"Equipo liviano, eficaz y batería de alto rendimiento"	"El único problema que se me presentó, es que en Uruguay el Voltaje es de 230 Voltios, por lo consiguiente tuve que salir a comprar un transformador. Ya sabía que esto iba a ser necesario. El equipo es una joyita muy práctica por el ángulo de corte y los accesorios totalmente acorde a cada necesidad en el corte o recorte de barba o pelo (esto último no lo recomiendo por tratarese de una máquina diseñada para barba; para pelo hay otras opciones)."
8/27/2019	Amazon	1	battery doesnt last	battery last for half shave so you can look like a clown
8/27/2019	Amazon	5	Very usefull	Very good!!
8/27/2019	Amazon	5	Great trimming	Love these trimmers
8/28/2019	Amazon	5	Worth it	"Did exactly what it said, beats the $200 shaver that died in a year"
8/28/2019	Amazon	5	Battery life	This item does it all. And battery life is amazing
8/28/2019	Amazon	5	Great buy	It's a gift the Battery is great
8/29/2019	Amazon	4	very good	does a good job
8/29/2019	Amazon	5	Works Great	works like a trimmer should work
8/29/2019	Amazon	5	Good value for $	"So far, so good. Good value for $ as my Norelco went out and didn't want to spend much.  Would recommend."
8/29/2019	Amazon	5	So far so good	"Got it today, no hair tearing or left over hairs.  It does its job."
8/29/2019	Amazon	1	USED?!	"This looks like it came in used. Did you repackage a used product and re-sold it back to the customer?  If you zoom into the picture with the white packaging you can clearly see human stubble. The whole box in its entirety came in with all the attachments out of their packaging, and with many missing the plastic bags! Some of the plastic bags were worn out and many of the attachments were clearly used. If you look at the picture of the nose trimmer attachment you can see what appears to be dried residue of something, I'm assuming shaving craving. There was many little stubble pieces all throughout the box.  This NOT how you retain customers. This is disgusting."
8/30/2019	Amazon	5	Good all around trimmer	This kit has alot of good extensions. They get the job done to keep facial hair in check.
8/30/2019	Amazon	1	Junk. Dont buy. First time I ever said.	Had it for 3 months and now the battery doesn't charge. Trashed it. Waiting on a different brand and if it doesn't recharge going back to battery operated.
8/30/2019	Amazon	1	Battery died quickly.	"Battery stopped holding a charge a few weeks after purchase. This was the 2nd time I purchased this product, the first was a year prior. I had hoped I just got a dud, but judging from other reviews, it's shoddy workmanship."
8/30/2019	Amazon	5	Does what I want it to	I use it to buzz my head and torso/arms. Does a good job so far
9/1/2019	Amazon	3	Good but could be much better	"My first multi-use, body groomer. I purchased it mainly to tend to my private areas. I have normal hair throughout the body otherwise. First off, I was able to get a pretty close cut in the private areas which I previously strggled with, with other types of shavers / trimmers, very often getting cuts and nicks and bleeding, esp. you guys know where! This time it went much better. I tried without the guard on the body trimmer attachment. I managed to get a good, very short trim witohut any nicks or cuts. That's good. I also was NOT looking for a close shave equivalent of a high-priced face shaver in the private areas for obivous reasons. It's light, small. But I was hoping to replace two of my other trimmers (a Panasonic nose trimmer and a pen-like trimmer for nose, ear and light-hair. But I am disappointed :o(  These could use improvements: - Can't tell how long it takes to charge as there's no visual indicator. It's says 3-5 hours. The light in mine stayed red even after 3-5 hours. Not sure if it's supposed to turn green - The nose trimmer is one of the worst designs anyone could ever imagine. I understand it's also made for eyebrows... while it may work there - never tried, it doesn't work very well in the nose. It barely has two - three teeth. You have to reach into the nose with back and forth motion while twisting it a bit.... it's like a contest to get those strands of hair into the 2-3 teeth! I have a Panasonic rotary nose trimmer or a small nose trimmer (the same shape as the body trimmer attacment included in this package) that does a FAR better job in the nose! - The vertical body trimmer attachment is good. But in order to blunt it for comfort-sake I would assume, Remington decided to make the outer teeth slightly bent. This makes it cut better in one sweeping direction than the other. I would have loved it to be truly uni-directional! It's annoying. Next time, I might try the full size trimmer for the body to see if it can make up for the shortcomings of the vertical trimmer."
9/1/2019	Amazon	5	Great product	"Works great, its pretty low on noise, doesnt cut you and the battery lasts so long i actually bought another one for my dad"
9/2/2019	Amazon	5	No e!	Very good !
9/2/2019	Amazon	5	Fair priced great product	I think Im still using the original charge months later! It works well its priced great you can spend a lot more if you want but this workhorse of a beard trimmer gets the job done while saving you some money compared to others... I would definitely recommend.
9/3/2019	Amazon	5	Great Transaction	great product for the price.
9/3/2019	Amazon	5	N	Great
9/3/2019	Amazon	5	Slim and light	"Slim and light, does what some of the bigger ones does and not as heavy."
9/3/2019	Amazon	3	Charging or battery issues	The trimmer worked great until it stopped charging. Barely 1 yr since purchase.
9/4/2019	Amazon	5	good quality	nice trimmer
9/4/2019	Amazon	1	IT'S USED AND FULL OF HAIR!!!!!!!!	"AFTER OPENING THIS ""NEW"" TRIMMER THE FIRST THING I SEE IS HUMAN HAIR EVERYWHERE!!! I BOUGHT A NEW ITEM NOT A USED/RETURNED ITEM!! THERES EVEN LOTION ON THE HANDLE! I WANT A NEW TRIMMER IMMEDIATELY!!!"
9/5/2019	Amazon	5	Battery life	Bought this 2 months ago and havent had to charge it. Does exactly what I need it to and wasnt expensive
9/5/2019	Amazon	5	Great battery life.	Great shaver for the money and I'm still on the original charge after 6 months of twice a week use.
9/5/2019	Amazon	1	Cannot adjust blade	Cannot adjust the closeness of shave unless you use a guard
9/6/2019	Amazon	2	Stopped working after few weeks	"Very comfortable and doing great job. I enjoyed using it, but after few weeks it stopped working."
9/6/2019	Amazon	5	Great shaver	Love this thing
9/6/2019	Amazon	2	Too few attachments	"Generally like the trimmer, there are too few beard length attachments. I cant get to a desired length with the 3 attachments provided."
9/6/2019	Amazon	5	Works great	Wanted to groom my new beard.  This is ideal
9/6/2019	Amazon	5	Great beard trimmer	This one replaces one I bought 20 years ago. Eady to keep my beard looking good and cheaper then others I've tried.
9/7/2019	Amazon	4	"Good battery life, no jams or hair pulling"	"I've been using this for several weeks to trim my beard. No battery issues, no hair pulling. The main clipper head, and adjustable guide make it easy to choose whatever length you're looking for. Only negative I have is the blade gets really hot after a while. You don't feel it with the guide on, but then I shave the hair back around my mouth and it's painfully hot."
9/7/2019	Amazon	4	Nice Trimmer	"Although I have given the battery life a 3/5 star rating, this is a very nice trimmer set.  The attachments make it easy to use for all kinds of applications and the trimmer itself seems to be plenty sturdy to hold up.  Charging time is quick, but it doesn't hold a charge as long as, say, the shaver I have from the same manufacturer, and I use the shaver every day and the trimmer less frequently.  I do, however, recommend giving this some consideration, particularly because of the flexibility of the attachments."
9/7/2019	Amazon	5	excellent shaving machine	"highly  recommended very sharp, mobile, silent and very helpful only lacks cleaning brush"
9/7/2019	Amazon	5	It does it all	I got a second one for travel.
9/7/2019	Amazon	5	Dad loves it!	Got this for my dad for his birthday after he lost his original one. He loves it and says its easy to use-enough that he wanted the same exact one he had before.
9/8/2019	Amazon	5	size of clippers is a plus	Very light wright
9/8/2019	Amazon	5	Charge lasts a long time	Great beard trimmer and gives a nice soft shave
9/8/2019	Amazon	5	Every man needs one!	I gave this as a gift to my boyfriend... he absolutely loves it! The battery life is as expected. The trimmers work flawlessly. Its small & portable. Easy to clean.
9/9/2019	Amazon	1	highly unreliable battery	"I've had this 8 months and it can't hold a charge, very disappointed  Would not recommend"
9/9/2019	Amazon	4	Works Great.	Does a great job trimming my beard.  No issues at all with battery life.  Can't beat this trimmer for the price.
9/9/2019	Amazon	5	best set I have had	the best I have found
9/9/2019	Amazon	5	The attachments help give a perfect trim or hair cut.	Best ever trimmer I've owned.

9/9/2019	Amazon	5	Great grooming tool	Good value for the price! Have no complaints with it!
9/10/2019	Amazon	5	Great Quality and Value for a Great Price!	"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the item. This is not the most expensive groomer on the market and I thought the value would be reflected in the quality. However, It trimmed and cut quickly and efficiently."
9/11/2019	Amazon	5	Works great!	"Long lasting battery, and works great!"
9/11/2019	Amazon	5	Nice trimmer	Nice little machine. Works good
9/12/2019	Amazon	4	Ok	Ok

9/13/2019	Amazon	5	Great trimmer for travel!	"The shaver/trimmer is nice and have had it for awhile and taken it on trips. It does last for a long time. I use it just to trim sides. I wish it had better grips, very slippery if you hands are wet."
9/13/2019	Amazon	3	Set up of the package. This is not a travel kit. It is meant for home.	This is not a travel kit. It is meant for the home.
9/13/2019	Amazon	4	Works good	Beard
9/13/2019	Amazon	5	Easy to handle	"Works well, great battery life"
9/14/2019	Amazon	5	Great ????	Love it
9/14/2019	Amazon	1	False advertisement	"Ive been looking for a beard trimmer with the foil attachment thats hot prohibitively expensive. I saw this, and bought it just to find out that despite it saying it had a foil attachment, it was never included."
9/14/2019	Amazon	5	Great razor. Nice gift!	This is a great razor. My husband loves it!! Great value!
9/14/2019	Amazon	5	Great razor. Nice gift!	This is a great razor. My husband loves it!! Great value!

9/15/2019	Amazon	5	Great product	"Works amazingly well, great price too!"
9/15/2019	Amazon	4	"Pretty good razor but it's loud, really loud"	Pretty good razor and it's able to cut really well. My only complaint is that it's extremely loud.
9/15/2019	Amazon	3	"Can't use..screen damaged, scratches skin."	"After first use, the blade wore through a few of the holes in the screen. Realized after it scratched the crap it of my leg. Haven't been able to use since. Figured if it was good for a man's beard, would work as a quick leg shave.. Not so much.. At all now. I bought one previously for my son, and seems to work okay for him. I must have gotten a bad one and don't really use the other attachments. Mainly bought for the screen shaver. Really bummed. Put away being busy and forgot about it. Why is it so flipping hard to find something that isn't defective ??"
9/15/2019	Amazon	5	Compact	Great for everyone
9/15/2019	Amazon	1	Do not buy if you want a razor that will hold a charge	"Long story short, the battery on this is awful. It will work great for just long enough that you can't return it to Amazon. Then once you have made it past their return date the battery will no longer hold a charge. I had an older model of this exact razor and it worked great, but the new model is awful. They must be getting cheap batteries or something"
9/15/2019	Amazon	5	Best trimmer Ive owned	Best beard trimmer Ive owned lightweight precise even use it to trim my hair because its better than my trimmers.
9/15/2019	Amazon	5	INFORMACION SOBRE LA ENTREGA DE LAS COMPRAS.	"BUENAS TARDES. EN LA MAÑANA ESCRIBI UN MENSAJE HACIENDO UNA DEVOLUCION DE LOS ARTICULOS, ESTOS NO HABIAN LLEGADO A SU DESTINO. A LAS 12 DEL MEDIODIA APROXIMADAMENTE RECIBI LOS LENTES FOTOCROMATICOS QUE HABIA COMPRADO POR LA PAGINA, PERO LA MAQUINA DE CORTAR CABELLO NO ME LLEGO. POR FAVOR SI PUEDEN INFORMARME QUE HA OCURRIDO CON ESE ARTICULO."
9/16/2019	Amazon	3	Value for money	Not the best quality
9/16/2019	Amazon	1	Only worked for a month	Went totally dead four days after the return deadline. Charge light comes on but unit does not run. Useless.
9/16/2019	Amazon	1	"Broke, from vanity height fall"	"I was very disappointed in this, not for its function but for its durability after having this one day I knocked it off of the bathroom vanity and it broke metal on the trimmer head. Now its useless and I am out my purchase price. I will not buy this model again."

9/16/2019	Amazon	5	Dependable	Great price
9/17/2019	Amazon	5	Buena	Buena para la barba justo para lo que está echa
9/17/2019	Amazon	1	It never recharged!	"This shaver did its job as long as the battery ran out of power. It lasted over a year with no charge needed, but then, when I connected it, it never charged. It is a waste of money and materials. Objects like this are really an inconvenience and are bad for the environment."
9/17/2019	Amazon	5	A Good Trimmer!	Happy with it.
9/18/2019	Amazon	5	Recommend	Muy bueno
9/18/2019	Amazon	1	BAD do not buy HORRIBLE battery	"Worst trimmer DO NOT BUY!  Battery stops holding a charge after 15 charges. Save your money on this one, lots of other options out there."
9/18/2019	Amazon	2	Its ok.	I guess my hair is to hard to cut.  It pulls instead of cutting.  And yes I know how to shave my face.  Wouldnt buy again.
9/18/2019	Amazon	2	NO CARGA DESDE LA PRIMERA VEZ	DEFECTUOSO . NO CARGA
9/18/2019	Amazon	5	excellent	product is excellent.  best attachments. clean shave all over

9/21/2019	Amazon	5	Awesome	Still using it on the factory charge
9/22/2019	Amazon	4	As advertised	Gift for son he liked it
9/22/2019	Amazon	1	BAD BATTERY LIFE	The battery LITERALLY lasts 10 mins. When it comes to charging it takes about an hour an a half for it to be FULLY CHARGED. I like to trim my beard every week and if you do the same I would NOT recommend this trimmer.
9/22/2019	Amazon	5	Perfect for home use	Perfect. Easy to use and the guards are great.
9/22/2019	Amazon	4	Shaver is just okay.	Good value. Two of the four heads are valuable.
9/22/2019	Amazon	5	Works great!	Purchased as a gift for my boyfriend. It works great and he loves it!
9/23/2019	Amazon	1	Trash city	"Wasnt too bad when I first got it, the shave is pretty close BUT the overall product is just cheap plastic and the battery last less than a minute now. Had this mf for like a month and I already gotta buy a new one."
9/24/2019	Amazon	1	Stalled out after 6 months	Was running great for around 6 months then out of no where stopped working. The battery light was still on but the razor wouldn't start. Don't recommend this if you want to invest in a razor that lasts for a long period of time.
9/24/2019	Amazon	1	Stopped working after using for few weeks	Very disappointed with this purchase. This trimmer stopped working all of a sudden one day. It just lasted for only a one month. It won't turn on even after charging for few hours. Do not understand what's the problem is with the device. I would recommend others to stay away from this cheap device and avoid purchasing this crap. Remington just lost all its credibility with this device.
9/24/2019	Amazon	5	Easy to use	Bought it for my son. He found it easy to use
9/25/2019	Amazon	5	Exactly what I needed	Good product works well.
9/25/2019	Amazon	5	Most versatile electric shaver	This trimmer is extremely versatile and works very well as a daily shaver/trimmer. Gifted it to my younger brother and he has been very pleased with it. Will be recommending/gifting to others from now on.
9/26/2019	Amazon	1	Does not cut hair close to skin	Does not cut hair close to skin
9/27/2019	Amazon	4	I dont know	It works good
9/27/2019	Amazon	5	Works Great!	Lithium battery lasts a long time.
9/27/2019	Amazon	5	Great buy for a great product	Great buy for a great product
9/27/2019	Amazon	4	"Great for personal use, excellent gift."	"This is my 3rd time purchasing from Remington. This was a gift for someone who used the one I own and loved it. The first one I dropped in water and although you can use it wet I don't think it was meant to be submerged in more than 4 ft of water lol. But it worked so well I just repurchased the same one. The first one I'd had for 2 almost 3 years this one is going on almost 3 year also, battery does well if you don't leave it charging overnight all the time. Usually takes about 30mins to charge and depending what you're using it for I can get 5-6 uses or more before having to charge. My friend uses it for his beard, body grooming and to cut his hair, he normally does all of that every time he uses it and I believe he gets 2-3 uses per charge (I'm not all up on his grooming regimen, I just know because he stayed with me for 2 months while his house was getting rebuilt) so I'd say it's fairly solid and holds a decent charge and in my opinion based on my friend's needs it's a bit of a work horse lol."
9/27/2019	Amazon	1	Don't waste your money...	"Barely runs after a full charge.  Used it for a month and then smashed it from frustration.  After full charge the motor sounds like it's on it's last leg.  Won't buy Remington again.  These kind of little trimmers usually last me about 2 years, so I understand what to expect as far as quality for the money, definitely the worst I've ever had."
9/27/2019	Amazon	5	Best for money!	Great value.  Quite running.
9/27/2019	Amazon	5	Good trimmer	"Great for my husband's beard trimming. This is the second we've bought. The first lasted nearly 3 years before the battery ran out, which is really good for the price."
9/28/2019	Amazon	1	Battery dead!!	Battery completely died on me. Cannot be charged any more. It's only been 10 months ! Is there warranty?
9/29/2019	Amazon	1	Garbage	Run trimmer over same spots over and over only to see SOME of the hairs trimmed while others pop back up.  Beard is no longer than a 1/4 inch.  Trimmer only works if you use the short combs.
9/29/2019	Amazon	5	Use a guard if your shaving your scrotum	Does everything I need it to do
9/29/2019	Amazon	5	Great value!	Excellent quality!
9/29/2019	Amazon	1	"the item come used, i was expecting for a new trimmer."	visible left over hair inside the package and the trimmer has visible signs of being used.
9/29/2019	Amazon	1	I've had three Remingtons and this is now the bottom of the barrel.	"I had a Remington trimmer/shaver of this basic model, etc. from a few years ago that ran for a couple of years. It was great. When it died I bought THIS model for Christmas 2018. It died in June and I was disappointed. I bought a replacement of the same model so I could reuse the same attachments and charger thinking I got a lemon. However the one I just bought after charging it overnight is WEAKER than the last one. My sons also have one that was gifted to them at Christmas 2018 and it is still going. But the one I just bought for myself is WEAKER than my son's from 2018 and that's after charging it overnight.  I don't know what Remington is doing but STAY AWAY from their shavers until they figure out the following:  1. Decent battery with decent power and longevity. 2. Moisture resistance. The one I bought from 2018 Christmas I dissected when it died. There is NO waterproofing or anti-moisture in the whole assembly. I didn't get mine wet but I did shave in a humid bathroom and after taking it apart it was clear there are NO rubber seals, nothing in the seams (gel or anything) to keep moisture out. 3. The charging indicator light is WORTHLESS. It doesn't show if it's charging or not, it just shows if power is making it to the circuit board. There are also NOT three lights (even though there are three plastic windows). It's just ONE light that is on if the circuit board is getting power form the charging cable. It doesn't shut off when it's charged or give any indication if the battery has a charge.  So my recommendation is to STAY AWAY from Remington shavers until they get their issues worked out as their current shavers are POS on battery life, power, moisture resistance and decent components."
9/29/2019	Amazon	5	Great trimmers. Battery seems to last a long time	These are good quality trimmers. I've been using them for a  while now and they work just as good now as the first day I used them. The battery life seems to be very long between charges. The different trimmer head is easy to swap out. Great trimmers.
9/30/2019	Amazon	5	Great product	Gifted it to my husband and so far it's worked great. The battery life is long and it trims evenly.
9/30/2019	Amazon	5	Excelente artículo	Excelente artículo. La batería dura mucho. Fácil de limpiar y muy precisa!
9/30/2019	Amazon	5	"A clean, close shave."	"Works great, doesn't pull and gives a very close shave. I sometimes just use the foil head instead of my razor."
9/30/2019	Amazon	5	Smart buy!	Freakin stoked to find this awesome trimmer for such a great price.
9/30/2019	Amazon	5	Excellent product	Just as advertised
