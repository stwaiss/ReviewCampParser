10/12/2015,Amazon,5,Remington is quality,"My husband has a short, well kept beard and has a few beard trimmers but none are Remington so he was excited to give it a go. I personally swear by my Reminton ladies shaver so I already knew Remington has quality products.  The main thing and most important thing for my husband is that this is waterproof. He does like to shave in the shower, we do have a little shower mirror in there.  This shaver has a great hand feel, not too light, not too heavy and doesn't slip when wet. It has a 3 hour charge. It doesn't take my husband 3 hours to trim his beard (thank goodness) but it's nice for my husband because he travels overnight for his job and sometimes forgets his charger. This has titanium coated blades which give it a quality feel and smooth grooming experience. There are a total of 11 attachments including a nose hair trimmer!  It all packs up nicely in a zip up bag. My husband is always on the lookout for quality products that make his shaving/grooming easier and doesn't irritate his skin. He said this one ranks up there with the best.  My uncle has a full on beard, like thick and a few inches long and my husband suggested we get him this for Christmas."
10/13/2015,Amazon,5,Top-notch grooming kit by Remington,"This 11 piece shaving set is perfect for the guy who likes to have a beard but doesn't want to spend a lot of time and money on grooming. I got this for my son who lives overseas, so he could use it when he visits me. It is handy and lightweight but gets the job done. He really likes the nose, ear and eyebrow hair trimmer attachment too.  It uses a lithium battery and the charge lasts for 3 hours. All of the 11 pieces fit neatly into a zippered case which is included, so it is a great grooming kit for travel as well. Since it is 100% waterproof, it may be used in the shower also which is a real plus for guys on the go!"
10/15/2015,Amazon,5,makes trimming/shaping beard much easier,"I find this trimmer to be much easier to use than the integrated trimmed on my Braun shaver.  The battery seems to last for days without any noticeable slowdown.  Going on almost a week now.  The blade is quite sharp, making quick work of the very thick hairs I have.  I am quite happy thus far with how this produce handles and performs.  Inwill nm provide regular updates to let you know how this trimmer has held up over time.  Hopefully it will last as long as my Panasonic combo shaver/trimmer which I've had for almost 10 years now."
10/17/2015,Amazon,5,"Great shaver, most people will want the Remington Crafter (not the Beardsman)","Remington has 2 new product lines, each with Regular vs Deluxe: The Craftsman (Regular vs Deluxe Copper Edition), and The Beardsman (Regular vs Deluxe Copper Edition).  The Copper editions are more sleek looking (with the copper finish), come with more accessories, and the heads are a little heavier duty. Plus, the Copper editions are only about $10 more expensive, which is probably worth it.  The Beardsman is for thicker beards - it has a detail trimmer on the shaver unit, but otherwise, most of the attachments are comb trimmers for long thick beards. The Crafter has much more versatile features. It seems to have basically the same comb attachments as the Beardsman, plus lots of extras: A mini roil shaver, nose & ear trimmer, in addition to the comb attachments.  Also, for the same price, the Crafter gives you 60 minutes more battery life with a Max Lithium Battery (3 hrs vs. 2 hrs). I suspect most people will want the Crafter.  Both models have titanium coated blades, which really makes a difference. Titanium is stronger, stays sharp longer, and more resistant to clogging & rust. This makes either of these Remington products super to most other shavers out there.  Finally, these Remington ""Beard Boss"" products aren't just for beards. The Crafter's heavy duty blades work for trimming hair, shaving heads, ""manscaping"" other body parts, and work great for simple goatees as well."
10/19/2015,Amazon,4,"Clean, sharp cuts!","Nice little tool. Grip is nice, carrying pouch is good too (I travel a great deal).  This will replace my Wahl hair clipper, which I've been using for trimming."
10/20/2015,Amazon,5,The perfect multi-angle groomer.,"The perfect multi-angle groomer. The Remington Crafter may hide its mustache trimmer attachment under the name ""arc detailer,"" but Remington, we know what it is--its a mustache trimmer and it works pretty darn well. Ditto the nose hair trimmer attachment. When I stuck it up my nose I was afraid I would lope something valuable off, but I should not have been afraid--it did the job swiftly and efficiently, and no blood involved.  The exchange of heads can be a bit fiddly, but overall, this is a great multi-tool for keeping one's hair in check.  Recommended."
10/20/2015,Amazon,5,Lots of attachments,"I got this beard trimmer for my 22 yr. old son. He is always on the run and likes to shave as quickly as possible. He likes that this is water proof, because he can use it in the shower when he is in a rush. This has a lot of attachments so he can trim his beard and mustache to the right length.  It holds a charge for a long time, once it's charged up. He loves the zip up storage bag for the days that he stays at his girlfriend's house, or when he stays at one of his friends houses. I always liked Remington products, because they are very good quality. This is no different, so I now it will now be my son's favorite."
10/24/2015,Amazon,5,"Smooth shave, easily works on thick, curly hair","My husband tested this (since I'm not a bearded woman!) and is most impressed. He has a very thick and curly beard, coarse, and difficult to cut using the shears we had before, which he says pull. This provided a smooth shave, easily moving through his hair and not pulling or causing discomfort. He used several of the add-on parts, and all worked wonderfully. If you or someone in your family has been looking for the appliance to help control facial hair, this is it. Recommended."
10/28/2015,Amazon,5,Nice Shaver and Options,"I got this shaver to replace a smaller size Wahl that lasted about 4 years and then would not charge again. Right out of the box I was impressed with the style and amount of attachments for trimming all parts of your mustache, beard or side burns. The nose/ear trimmer actually work much better than the round style with the blades located inside the top. This one has the sliding vs. rotating blades, which give a better cut. The foil trimmer is also great for the side burns to leave a clean look. I pretty much use the mid size attachment as I keep my beard and mustache short. Some of the designs and pictures on the box are quite impressive; however, I do not suspect that I will grow a beard or mustache like those anytime soon. The battery life so far has been holding up. 5 days of use so far and I have not charged it. The carry case is very nice and will hold all the accessories and charger for travel. A nice quiet sound and easy to grip handle. Very impressive shaver that I am sure will give many years of service."
11/2/2015,Amazon,4,Great trimmer,"This Remington is a great trimmer. It bills itself as being for beards, but it's really just a typical multi-trimmer. It comes with different heads to swap out for trimming different areas in varying styles, and multiple combs to select for hair length. The nose/ear trimmer is something I never thought I'd need, but passing 40 educated me otherwise; the shape of this accessory is different from my old Remington and works a lot better.  I prefer my Philips Norelco QT4022 for pure beard/mustache trimming, but this Remington is a great overall trimmer. With all the attachments it takes up more space on the counter, but the battery life really seems to be no joke. I left it off the charger for a week and it still roared through trimming my goatee with no problem. Of course, new batteries haven't suffered self-discharge for as long, and I've learned to expect battery life to shorten dramatically after a couple years, but that's true of all trimmer (and battery) manufacturers.  If you've ever used a Remington, you'll get the same great quality trimmer with the same heads and combs. But they've improved the performance just enough that upgrading from your old trimmer is worth the cost. I really like this set. And if versatility is your thing, this is what you need."
11/3/2015,Amazon,3,"Jack of all Trades, Master of One","I currently have a Panasonic ER-GB80-S trimmer as well as a Remington PG6250 Wettech Head, Beard and Body Grooming trimmer which is my favorite of the two.  So, I was excited to get this update to my Remington, especially since the Remington Crafter included a variety of attachments that I could use.  However, the excitement was short lived once I started using the Crafter.  While it has a lot of different uses thanks to the different attachments, I found that it only excelled at trimming hair and not as a nose hair trimmer or as a shaver using the foil.  Whats in the box? In the box along with the trimmer and the power cord are six comb attachments, a mini foil shaver, a nose and hair trimmer and a detail trimmer (which is basically just a narrower trimmer head).  A storage bag is also included.  Ergonomics and design The design of the Remington Crafter is nice.  It is smaller than the offerings by Panasonic and has a narrower trimming head which makes it easier to use around your ears and nose.  It has a good weight and fits very well in an adult's hands.  The body of the trimmer is covered in a soft rubber material which is nice for maintaining your grip on the trimmer but terrible otherwise because pieces of hair stick to the material.  Granted, small pieces of hair will be found on most trimmers after you use them, but the Remington Grafter seems to attract more.  It is impossible to brush or blow the hair off and so you need to wash the trimmer under the sick to clean it up which conveniently you can do.  Adjustments You adjust the trimming length by switching between the different combs.  The combs are snapped on and off of the trimming head.  This works well for my Remington Wettech trimmer, but not for the Crafter.  I found that it takes a bit of pressure to release the comb which usually causes the trimming head to pop off of the body which is a bit of a pain, especially if the body is wet and water gets introduced inside the trimmer.  You can interchange between the nose trimmer attachment, the foil attachment and the detail trimmer attachment by pulling one attachment off of the body and then pressing the new attachment one and turning it until it is secured in place.  This is not always straightforward because the mechanism inside of the body which causes the blades to move can rest on one side of the opening and it must be moved over before you can lock the attachment into place.  The nose trimmer attachment is long compared to dedicated nose hair trimmers such as the Panasonic ER430K.  While the trimmer does a good job around the ears, I dont think it excels as a nose hair trimmer.  The cutting edge is only on the top rather than all around the front of the attachment as is the case for the Panasonic ER430K.  Cutting speed There are two blade speeds which you toggle between by pressing the power button.  I usually use the power boost option when trimming hair regardless of how thick the hair is that I am cutting.  Maintenance The instructions indicate that you should oil the blades regularly.  However, unlike the Panasonic trimmers, no oil was provided.  The Crafter does come well oiled to the point that there was excess oil on the side of the trimmer when I opened the box.  Conclusions Overall, this is a nice trimmer.  However, due to the difficulty in swapping combs, my preference for a dedicated nose hair trimmer and that the trimmer comes apart when I want to change combs, I prefer the lower cost Remington PG6250 over the Crafter."
11/3/2015,Amazon,4,Remington PG6170 Trimmer,Used the Remington PG6170 the other day for trimming some facial hair and eye brows (at that age when the eyebrows are trying to get out of control!).  The product worked well and liked the following features:  - Easy to turn on and adjust speed. - Easy to grip. - Effective trimming. - Ample attachments for different applications. - Nice storage pouch for the trimmer and attachments.  Other trimmers I've had needed to be stored in a bulky box and took up too much room. - Was not loud like other trimmers I've had. -  Attachments were easy to install and take off.  A good product and I look forward to many years of use.
11/9/2015,Amazon,3,Some attachments don't work for me.,"When I received  the Remington eleven piece grafter style detail kit, I was hoping it was better than the Remington PG-180 that I own.  Out of the eleven attachments I will only be using the adjustable comb unit.  The mini foil and nose and ear hair attachments do not work for me.  The standard trimming head unit works better that my old unit.  I have to make multiple passes with the old trimming unit to cut all the hair, but with this new one it cuts in one pass.  Next time I will just purchase the main unit without all the attachments."
11/25/2015,Amazon,5,One tool that does everything you need for a beard,"I'm very pleased with this for all of the facial grooming I need to have a well maintained beard. It has a clipper and adjustable comb guard to cut the beard to the desired length. Without the comb, the clipper can cut a clean edge. It also has a smaller edger for doing the mustache. The only let down is the foil shaver. It's really small and only does on OK job. But I can live with that tradeoff for the convenience of everything being in one tool."
2/3/2016,Amazon,4,Great product!,"This is a great razor! My husband loves it! I was a little worried about some of the negative reviews that I read, but decided to purchase it anyway.  I have not found any faults with it except the price. I found it $20.00 cheaper in a couple of stores, and that is the only reason I gave it a 4 star."
2/23/2016,Amazon,4,Brush????,"Overall the trimmer works great, all the attachments are easy to interchange, charging is a snap. The nose trimmer is awful and a cleaning brush needs to be included.  I figured that was a lock, but apparently not.  That's why it only got 4 stars"

3/20/2016,Amazon,5,Excellent Beard Trimmer,"So much quieter than the P*****s that it replaced. Much easier to clean.and operate. Much longer lasting battery charge. Has a good, quality feel to it. If you need a beard trimmer, this is the one."

4/10/2016,Amazon,5,Best multi unit set I ever bought,"Best multi unit set I ever bought! Easy on and off adapters plus a bag to store it.  Since I grow hair everywhere - it was nice to have an accessory for my nose, ears, and facial hair.  The adjustable hair trimmer locks into place with a push button."
4/10/2016,Amazon,5,From a girl who appreciates a good looking beard,"Okay gents, if you want a swoon-worthy beard that will make the women take a second look, buy this thing. My boyfriend loves it (as do I). I got it for him for Christmas 4 months ago and every time he uses it he talks about how well it works. He has a beard and mustache and when he trims it up with this it looks pretty much perfect as if he went to a barber. All the parts included are awesome and the adjustable lengths are great if you want to use this for your beard, hair, or back of the next (he's a hair boy). So glad I chose this trimmer, not to mention it's one stylish looking trimmer. The battery life is good and I actually enjoy trimming him up now. Perfect for touch-ups that leave your beard smooooooth and sexy ."
4/18/2016,Amazon,5,"Good Trimmer, Excellent Nose Trimmer...","I like this beard trimmer. I only use it to shave my head before using my cartridge razor if I have let my hair get too long, and to trim nose and ear hair. I love the nose and ear trimmer, it does a great job at getting all of the hair in those areas, and trims the hair to a very short length.  The normal speed of the trimmer seems slow, so I use the boost speed so that it has a similar speed to other trimmers that I have used."
4/21/2016,Amazon,1,Terrible!!!,Worst feeling ever and battery that has to be charged for hours before every use. Asked and received a refund from Amazon.
4/23/2016,Amazon,5,Five Stars,Works as promised I've been very happy so far
4/26/2016,Amazon,5,This is an amazing package! The guards all do a good job ...,"This is an amazing package! The guards all do a good job of staying put and not clogging the trimmer too much. The battery holds a charge that makes my phone blush in envy. I have used it both at my sink and in the shower, and wet or dry, it performs well without being damaged by water. Easy to clean attachments make for quick use. One of my favorite features is the nose hair trimmer. I've tried multiple methods of nose hair removal from another dedicated nose hair trimmer, which was far from adequate, and even plucking them out with tweezers, which is effective, but requires more manliness than most have at their disposal to perform. The nose hair trimmer that comes with this does an incredible job of trimming nose hairs incredibly short, and I've never once felt the blades pinch the nose hairs, nor nick the inside of my nose."
5/26/2016,Amazon,5,Five Stars,This performs better than any other trimmer I have ever owned. But I did have some crummy trimmers.

6/6/2016,Amazon,1,Stopped working after 35 days. Used it 3 times.,What a piece of garbage. I used it 3 times and it stopped working. Battery shows as fully charged and it will not turn on. Of course I am a few days past the 30 day return policy. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this PoS.
6/7/2016,Amazon,4,Great product,"This trimmer kit is truly a great value. The trimmer itself seems to be of a high quality. I had been looking to purchase a new trimmer so I did a bit of research and for the price, I felt this was the best deal. I'm in the process of seeing how much I can grow my beard in a year, but having the ability to ""edge"" my beard and keep the growth vertical instead of horizontal is great. The battery life on the trimmer is great. Charged it fully when I got it and haven't had to plug it in yet. The guards are great and having all the options that Coke with this trimmer is handy. The bag it came with leaves a little to be desired, and by that I mean it's cheap. But there is nothing wrong with it being cheap to keep cost down. After all, it does what it's supposed to. All in all, I believe this trimmer is a great purchase for anyone...bearded or not. And for all the extras, I believe the price point is very good."

7/10/2016,Amazon,5,Stylish and very functional,Replacing an old trimmer I loved with this one.  Bought it specifically for the way the various heads twist on and off.  So much easier to use.  The 20 setting attachment is great for beard and mustache.  The small head works good for nose hair.  Charges quick and keeps a good charge.  Comes with a light weight zippered bag.  The turbo speed is also quite useful. Basically it is a two speed trimmer.  Only drawback is you have to cycle the speeds to turn it off.  You might also find you need to clean it more often.  As for style it is the nicest looking trimmer I have ever had.  Highly recommend it.

This beard trimmer is easy to use and produces great results.The adjustable guide has plenty of gradations to choose from and stays solidly in place, making it possible to fine-tune the length of your beard and produce a neatly groomed look.

8/11/2016,Amazon,5,Really impressed so far!!,This thing is great! i was looking for something rechargeable and pretty strong because my beard can get pretty thick. I have a very small styling trimmer but it just did not have enough power to fix No Shave November. I wanted something that had a couple of attachment so that i could find a style that i liked best and the adjustable attachment that comes with this if really neat for making it easy to blend together a few different length cuts.
8/11/2016,Amazon,4,Looks better than it works,"Surprisingly, it is neither as sharp or as powerful as its much older predecessor - I was looking forward to a stronger, more precision machine, but it's not.  I miss the old model which this replaced.  Sometimes new models are not better - a truism.  It comes with a ridiculous number of attachments, most of which I'm not likely to use, and yet, no brush to clean the head (which the old model came with).  It looks nice, however, if that matters."
8/11/2016,Amazon,5,Remington Beard Trimmer,This is my second beard trimmer and I'm glad that I purchased it. The trimmer works like a charm and is so much better than my previous trimmer from another well known company.

8/23/2016,Amazon,5,The Crafter is a great value and works well!,"It is quiet, cuts well and the various attachments come in handy. You can't expect to shave with the shaver attachment but it does work on small areas to clean up where a full size shaver can't get in. After having used a previous trimmer for 6 years the Crafter does have a bit of a learning curve but I am doing better each time. I admit I really like the ultra small cutting attachment. It is very easy to trim small areas or even one hair! I didn't think I would care for the ear/nose attachment but it works great. There is no pulling and the two cutting lines are shaped very smooth so I noticed no catching on the soft ear skin. All of the attachments are solid and attach firmly."

10/9/2016,Amazon,1,The blue light looks nice in the dark but I'm still giving one star,It doesn't work; only the light comes on during charge and after the first charge.  The blue light looks nice in the dark but I'm still giving one star.
10/10/2016,Amazon,5,Buy it!,"Absolutely the best trimmer I have ever used. Just rinse it to clean it. The attachments work flawlessly, going on and coming off easily. The ear and nose trimmer works like no other I have tried. Well worth the money."

10/12/2016,Amazon,1,Don't bother,"Very cheaply made.  If you have a thick beard/hair the attachments are useless.  Really poor quality.  Sorry Remington, the last one I owned was pretty good, but not this one."

10/24/2016,Amazon,5,BETTER THAN MOST,I cut my husbands hair and beard. He will not go to a barber or styling salon. But having this particular set makes it so much easier. Not too heavy and cuts very nicely. Use the oil on the blades before cutting and the little brush to clean it out after and it will do a good job for you.

11/5/2016,Amazon,4,Quiet and works so far,So far so good. I've only used it maybe five times so far. I can't believe how quiet it is. It's so quiet I feel like it won't cut anything-- but it does!

11/5/2016,Amazon,5,Five Stars,I love this machine! very quiet and cuts really well.
11/6/2016,Amazon,2,For FULL Beards only!,I was hoping this was an all-in-one where I could keep my clean cut look but have extra if I ever wanted to try growing my beard out. But this was not the case. The mini foil is truly MINI and you wont be able to shave your entire face with it. Its only for cleaning up small areas. The extended neck is NOT adjustable and practically worthless if you are trying to decrease as much length as possible before going to the foil.
11/10/2016,Amazon,1,Giant pile of garbage.,Stopped charging less than 2 months after purchased. only ever got 1 charge into it. Giant pile of garbage.

11/26/2016,Amazon,2,Horrible battery life,"The trimmer is nice, the attachments are nice, but the battery is garbage. I only use this for about a minute at a time to straighten up my neckline and clean up my cheeks while leaving my beard alone. I get about 2-3 uses before it's completely dead and I have to recharge. I'm talking about five minutes of actual usage and 2 weeks of sitting on the shelf before this thing dies. It's been like that since the day I got it and it's even slightly worse now. Do yourself a favor and keep searching and reading reviews. Do not buy this."

11/28/2016,Amazon,5,Five Stars,really seems to hold charge well.  works well in the shower.
11/29/2016,Amazon,4,A lot of parts in a decent quality for the price.,"Quick review: Worth the price, a good product with a lot of functionality, disassembled parts seem like that can break easily.  Full review: This product seems like it's supposed to answer all your facial hair (and maybe body hair too) needs, and in the end, it does.  The crafter comes with a basic head, that has 5 plastic attachments to it to change the length from 0-4, that means if you want one length in one place and a different one at another, you'll have to stop the trimming and change the plastic attachment.  You also get a plastic cover attachment for bigger heights, these seem unreasonable for a beard, but it's good to have the option.  You also get a narrow head for fine trimming, a flat head for eyebrows, nose hair and ears, and a guarded trimmer to completely remove hair.  I usually like to keep my beard at 1 (3mm) and it does a fine job at doing so, I can also change the head to get a fine line around my beard.  The product is waterproof but it didn't come with oil or a brush, so I have to use my old brush.  All the small parts come with a bag which is convenient.  Overall, the product feels good, but the changeable parts feel cheap like they can break easily. charging is easy but didn't come with an adapter so I had to use my own.  It's a good product for someone in his​ 20's ,but I feel like when this one breaks , I'd get a better model."
11/29/2016,Amazon,3,"Works for ""peach fuzz"" and finishing, need to spend more for a ""real"" trimmer.","If you don't know any better, this works, however, as a former barber used to professional equipment, this is a far cry from what I was used to.  I purchased the Remington PG6171 as I bought one for my grandson, who thinks it's a great beard trimmer.  Since my head has grown through the top of my hair, I just was using a #2 blade on my Andis clippers and would buzz everything.  I hoped this cordless Remington would produce similar results. Low on power, it works similar to a #4 ""outliner"" without the precision.  On the plus side, it doesn't seem to nick and if you use it after a corded trimmer to get a little closer cut, it does a great job of smoothing out and finishing.  I had hoped after charging it a few times it would gain a little more umpfh, as most lithium battery tools I have, seem to perform better after a few charge cycles, but it still is pretty weak and will not handle my fringe or my beard without assistance from my corded tools.  A great example of getting what you pay for."
11/30/2016,Amazon,5,Five Stars,Wonderful
12/1/2016,Amazon,5,apparently everything is OK.,apparently everything is OK.
12/2/2016,Amazon,1,A trimmer that doesn't ... TRIM!,"Based on the reviews, this trimmer seemed like the best choice.  As instructed by the manual, I charged the trimmer for 4 hours before using it.  Once it was fully charged, I unplugged the charger and proceeded to try the trimmer.  I pressed the ON/OFF button, the blue light came on, but nothing else seemed to happen.  At first I thought it had a safety lock somewhere, but I looked everywhere and there is nothing but the ON/OFF button.  I am deeply disappointed by this product and look forward to returning it.  Hopefully this is an isolated case and I was just unlucky, but one thing I'm certain of is that I won't be buying any Remington products anytime soon.  I have attached a video demonstrating the issue (sorry for the background noise).  Best regards, Ray"
12/2/2016,Amazon,4,Four Stars,REALLY GOOD- EXCELLENT BATTERY DURATION
12/2/2016,Amazon,1,No hole to put on tree top,This star was so misleading. Kinda made of a styrofoam at bottom and there is no Hole on bottom to put on top of tree. Had to make a hole myself to put on the top of tree. Luckily it was only a few bucks but save your $
12/2/2016,Amazon,5,Five Stars,great uit
12/4/2016,Amazon,3,Worked great until it broke,"Worked great while it lasted. I did not use this shaver often, maybe twice a week. It lasted about a year and a half before breaking. Tempted to leave 1 star for it breaking with such infrequent use, but was a 5 star while it worked. Average it out and 3 stars. Just glad it wasn’t too pricey."
12/5/2016,Amazon,5,This is by far the best razor myself or my husband have found,"This is by far the best razor myself or my husband have found. It does not dig into the skin like other razors. We used it twice so far and love it! Also love that it comes in a nice bag to keep the accessories together. That is much better than using a Ziploc bag to keep it together! I recommend. We will use it a couple more times, and will probably order another one!"
12/6/2016,Amazon,5,Myself and my wife were really amazed at the results,"Received this as a gift from my wife , my old one really needed to be replaced. After charging it I gave it a try. Myself and my wife were really amazed at the results, my wirey beard was smoother, cleaner looking and even. Would I recommend this product?  ABSOLUTELY!!"
12/7/2016,Amazon,2,It's ok for a quick shave,Nice till you  unscrew the screws to clean the hair out from inside the cutter now it pulls my hair sometimes and cuts.
12/7/2016,Amazon,5,read reviews and picked the Remington as the best. Very happy with it,first time growing a beard.  worried about how to care for it.  read reviews and picked the Remington as the best.  Very happy with it.  It works well and has lots of options.  caring for a beard is easy.

12/8/2016,Amazon,4,Nice price and product,"Has good shape and not ackward to hold. The adjustable comb is made well but the #5 guide combs are thin plastic. They snap into a metal head, this may not last a long time making comb move a you shave ... time will tell"
12/8/2016,Amazon,4,Great trimmer with all the attachments you need,"The battery in my old Wahl trimmer finally died after almost 8 years of service, so I needed a replacement. This is a great one! Not only is it waterproof, I like the case that came with it. It charged quickly and I haven't yet run it down. Comes with all the attachments you need, and honestly the best nose hair trimmer I've used. We'll see how it does over time, i'll come back and review it later and may bump to 5 stars."
12/9/2016,Amazon,5,Five Stars,"Long battery life, awesome"
12/10/2016,Amazon,5,Solidly built to last - better than the equivalent Wahl,"Remington PG6171 The Crafter: Beard Boss Style and Detail Kit, Male Trimming, Grooming (11 Pieces) Wahl Lithium Ion All In One Grooming Kit #9854-600  I had an opportunity to literally compare side-by-side this Remington The Crafter and the Wahl Lithium Ion All In One Grooming Kit #9854-600.  They were exactly the same price so I figured I should give it a thorough comparison.  Intially, I was so pleased with an older version of essentially the same Wahl model that I went out and purchased a second one.  As soon as I turned it on for the first time I noticed that the on/off switch wobbled and felt very plastic.  And when I plugged in the cord to charge the battery, I was reminded of the reason I needed the older model replaced: the little plug was extremely tight and I felt like I was going to break it, especially when I had to pull fairly hard to unplug it.  In the older model, I was very disappointed that the internals of the PLUG literally broke inside, leaving me no ability to charge my Wahl groomer.  Everything still worked perfectly!  That’s the rub.  After 4-5 years of daily use, it was still working as good as new.  I hated throwing it away just because of the power connector internals.  Not being satisfied with how “plastic fantastic” this was, I purchased a different brand that cost the same: a Remington “The Crafter” Style and Detail Kit.  After using both, I chose the Remington, but the Wahl did offer a few advantages.  Both have Lithium batteries.  Both come with a little case and multiple beard guides and fixed length combs.  The Wahl (W) featured a few things that most do not have, including the Remington (R): - A wider T-blade, which I think would make cutting hair easier (which is something I wouldn’t use it for) - It boasted 1-minute charging. It also allowed you to use it when plugged in and charging – the R does not.  This feature was very necessary with my older Wahl since the battery discharged much quicker after many years and wouldn’t hold a charge very well if not plugged in.  I just kept it plugged in for the most part.  (Remember, this is after 4-5 years of use.)  As far as functionality, I couldn’t tell a difference between the beard detail trimmer.  The included attachment guides, although slightly different, all function similarly, with the R offering an attachment that can be adjusted in smaller increments.  The R offers two motor speeds (the W, only one – but I always use the faster “turbo” speed on the R, which is essentially the same as the W, so that didn’t really matter to me).  The biggest advantage the Wahl had was the foil ultra-close shaver.  Wahl had a double head and was much wider.  It was noticeably faster and more thorough when shaving my neck and face areas.  This, alone, was ALMOST enough for me to keep the Wahl.  This advantage, however, introduced a big weakness, especially when compared to the Remington: Switching out the different heads (trimmer, foil shaver, nose trimmer) on the W always made me feel like I was going to break it because it seemed so cheaply made.  The pieces did not snap in easily.  I found myself trying to avoid switching to the other head simply out of fear of breaking it.  The R, on the other hand, requires a simple twist of the head both off and on (versus prying it off and fitting/snapping it back in after a bit of a struggle).  The R feels solid and I now never fear that switching out to my nose trimmer, for example, will break my trimmer.  The whole Remington Crafter feels much more solidly made.  The on/off button is a push button behind waterproof rubber.  The R is waterproof, by the way, while the W is not.  I think not being waterproof is what led to my older Wahl breaking at the power connection as there was a tiny hint of rust build-up.  The Remington uses a larger, rubber connector that doesn’t seem like it could break inside.  As I mentioned, the Wahl on/off switch literally jiggled around.  This did not affect its ability to switch it on and off, but the “plastic-ness” and the not solid feel really turned me off to this product as I give it just 6 months to a year before it breaks somehow.  Another difference was the nose trimmer.  Wahl’s was a roughly quarter-inch version of the trimmer.  It did its job reaching into my nose.  But the Remington has a very different, more functional design that reaches further in and around the nose.  If you have a big or long honker, you’ll want the Remington.  Mostly insignificant: the little attachments bag for the W was much better than the R. They’re both functional so that did not play into my decision.  Bottom line: The Remington is built much more solidly.  Despite my long history with a Wahl, I just couldn’t get past its plastic-fantastic cheaply-made feel, ESPECIALLY when compared to the Remington.  The one caveat is if you use the ultra-close foil shaver quite a bit for a large area of your neck and face: the Wahl’s version is much better.  (I just hope the little plastic pieces inside the heads don’t break when you switch between the trimmer and the ultra-close.)"
12/10/2016,Amazon,4,EXCELENT PRODUCT,Excelent product.Fast shipping and it brings everything on the picture.Only problem was it did not bring a small brush to clean the blades.Other than that best blades ive ever used.

It does all the more expensive trimmers do, and it does it well. Very quite, in case you like to shave at 4 am...lol. doesn't come with oil, so I suggest you get some Wahl Hair Clipper Blade Oil 4 oz. #3310-300, which works GREAT. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0084AWBRS/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3 . I read many who use the faster speed, but I have a light beard, and the slow speed is all I need. Very long battery life. I haven't had to recharge it yet. (although I haven't owned it too long). Cuts great no pulling. Much better than their older version, which was great, but the curve on this model is a bit different and it seems to make it a bit easier to get under chin."
12/10/2016,Amazon,1,BAD,Used 2 times and battery dies. This is the only Amazon review I've written - explaining my thorough disappointment with this trimmer. Bad waste of money

12/11/2016,Amazon,4,Four Stars,good
12/12/2016,Amazon,5,Happy with this after 1 month,"In November 2016, I bought this Remington PG6170 ""Crafter Beard Boss.""  It's quite large, but feels solid, not flimsy at all.  The attachments hold nice and firm, and there are enough attachments to run with the desired length.  I like the way it is advertised as ""water-proof"" albeit I do _not_ use it in the shower anyhow.  Also like the decent quality of the charger connector.  I'm happy with everything except the nose/ear/eyebrow trimmer attachment is awkward.  Not sure why 2-speeds was necessary; I run high speed all the time; what's the advantage of low speed -- it's so sharp (when new) it could accidentally gash a beard anyhow.  My cost was near $55 which is about $10 too high, but if it lasts 4+ years, I conclude it's worth it."
12/12/2016,Amazon,5,Works great,Works good and you get a lot of attachments.

I have 2 issues with the trimmer.  First, the blades were not very sharp to begin with and became duller with time.  Second, the motor is just plain weak.  Even on the faster cutting speed setting, this trimmer takes many passes over my relatively thin beard to actually get an even beard.  It pulls my facial hair as much as it cuts.

1/24/2017,Amazon,1,Big disappointment!,Would give it no stars if I was given that option. Bought this in September and it has already quit. It worked really well for the first month then gradually started shutting off even though it was fully charged. The last one I purchased was a little cheap one that I paid $15 for and it lasted 4 years!
1/28/2017,Amazon,5,happy housewife,this was a present for my husband and he loves and uses it all the time.

2/3/2017,Amazon,2,"Was so amazing, until...","I found everything about this trimmer perfect. I used it for nearly a year. The Beard Boss held a charge great, and quickly too. It had everything and I mean everything. I especially loved the sliding guard, no fiddling with snap-on guards. Until one fateful day, I was changing blade heads and set the trimmer on the counter to get what I needed. I bumped the trimmer and it fell to the floor in my search. I didn't think it would be a problem as it's well made.  It was a problem, a big one. The small metal nob that makes the whole thing work snapped off. It's not shielded by anything so there went my trimmer. I am giving it 2 stars for that issue. The metal was alloy so not a lot I could do with it.  I have since picked up a Whal trimmer, not as versitle, but okay and I noticed they have a similar design but the metal nob is shielded by the casing. A-ha! If only Remington had thought of that. So Beard Boss users be ware!"

2/10/2017,Amazon,5,Five Stars,"Good merchandise, highly recommend"
2/12/2017,Amazon,4,It holds a charge for weeks but really should be fully charged to get the best use from it,"I have had a number of beard trimmers - by Wahl and other.  For a portable unit, this seems to be well made and fairly precise.  If I have one complaint it is that I must remember to charge it the day before I decide to trim.  It holds a charge for weeks but really should be fully charged to get the best use from it.  Oh, and you can't use it when it is charging.  Good assortment of attachments though it is missing a blade guard for storage."
2/13/2017,Amazon,5,Five Stars,Great options with this.
2/14/2017,Amazon,2,Read before buying,"It takes to long to remove stubble. And when your ""done"" your chin is not smooth. Thers alway a few hair left. Took me more than 6 times to go over an area with stubble. Razor is still best option"
2/14/2017,Amazon,5,Great trimmer for my beard.,I really like this trimmer. It is well made and sturdy. It has every attachment you could want and performs just great. Charges quickly too. You'll love it as I do.
2/14/2017,Amazon,5,Great product,Cuts and trims flawlessly!
2/14/2017,Amazon,1,Worked great for about 2 months now I can't get the ...,Worked great for about 2 months now I can't get the thing to charge. I've tried several outlets several times and no matter how long it charges it won't hold. You can't use this product while it's plugged in so it's officially junk. Several of the attachments are very frail and have broken or had parts fall out even though I've never used them.  This is the first review I've ever written but I felt it was necessary based on my experiences.
2/15/2017,Amazon,1,Battery life is nonexistent.,I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas as his old trimmer was finally on its last leg. He was pleased at first but after less than 3 months the battery will no longer hold a charge. Which is ironic because the description of this tool says it's good for 180 hours or something. Of course this started happening after the return window ended so now he's stuck with a beard trimmer that he has to charge overnight EVERY time he wants to use it.  Total waste of money and not cheap either!
2/15/2017,Amazon,2,"Awkward to use, guide combs are a nuisance, pulls painfully hard at times","I bought this as a replacement for a 5 year old Norelco G370 that's served me well over the years, for which I could not find replacement extensions for an otherwise functional shaver. Unlike my old Norelco, the is way worse from a versatility and ease-of-use perspective.  - The guide combs require squeezing on very specific places to release and is usually a two-handed operation. - Unlike the Norelco, this doesn't come with a variably adjustable beard shaver extension. You only get the 5 preset lengths that the guide combs provide. In addition, this just creates more junk to sort through as you reach into the provided carrying pouch to find specifically what you need. - Even after charging, the motor doesn't feel particularly powerful. ""Turbo"" mode is about as strong as the normal setting on my Norelco. - This seems to be one of those shavers that pulls if you aren't careful. This can be very painful. My Norelco has always cut through with no pulling, not even after 5 years of constant use.  I'll update this review if my experience becomes more positive with continued use, but other than the longer battery life and waterproofing, I really don't think this stands up to my old, much cheaper Norelco G370. It really lacks where it counts -- creating a very awkward end user experience that doesn't seem like it would work well when rushing out the door in the morning."
2/19/2017,Amazon,5,Highly recommend,"Wonderful trimmer, it does the job."
2/21/2017,Amazon,5,which if these blades are as good as the blades on my last Remington trimmer that ...,"The only difference between this model and the higher end model is the colored siding and the titanium coated blades, which if these blades are as good as the blades on my last Remington trimmer that lasted me 14 years, 99% of that I had a beard and mustache, the lower model should fit anybody just fine.  If the batteries hadn't finally died out, I'd still be using my older model Remington.  The only reason I liked the older model better is because it had a dial you could rotate to adjust the trimmer length versus swapping out various size clips which you could lose, but this one so far seems to be as high quality as the one that lasted me 14 years.  No need for the two speed button...I doubt many people run on the lower speed so in the end it is a way for Remington to boast that they have a 180 minute run time on a speed not many people use, but beyond that little salesmanship gripe, it is a great beard trimmer.  The only reason that one died is the batteries finally wouldn't hold a charge.  I've used this one for months and only recharged it when I knew I'd not have any time to risk having a dead battery because I was going to be in a rush when I was getting off of work and about to shave (I work from home).  Battery life seems great, no matter which speed you use."
2/21/2017,Amazon,5,Five Stars,The level of precision is excellent.
2/21/2017,Amazon,5,Well worth it!,"Stop buying those cheap NiCad units and move up to this. I used to buy those every year or so because they wear out quickly and stop holding a charge. This unit provides a much better shave, the charge lasts multiple shaves, and is much smoother and quieter than those cheap box store units. Great job Remington!"

My thick beard has challenged the trimmers I have purchased in the past. I had to be slow and careful or the cutting blades would slowdown or stall and ""Ouch!"" This unit, even at normal speed, has plenty of power to trim my beard without stalling. I expect some of the attachments will remain unused, however, I am extremely pleased with my grooming purchase!"
2/23/2017,Amazon,5,"This is the perfect one, and I am going to order another ...","I have bought many, actually 6, beard trimmers in local stores and they all never did what I needed them to.

3/6/2017,Amazon,4,NO STORAGE STAND,"I love everything about this Trimmer EXCEPT: - It does not come with a 'Stand' for storing all the parts & pieces that come with it. - Only a small cloth bag to dump em in to!   (I did call Remington Support, and they confirmed that it does not come with a stand, and Kindly offered to send an additional 'bag', and a Stand they have for a Hair Cutting Kit, which is not made for this trimmer.)   But WHY, would this nice of a tool come without a stand like most others? - One has to dump the bag out onto the Countertop to find the parts that are needed for whichever task is in order at the moment! - A real PAIN, and Disappointment in the 'Storage Dept.!   (Also, - the instructions do not tell how these 'Parts' fit on to the Trimmer. - It can be figured out, but would have been a big help if the instructions told more about assembling it in the first place. - They are mostly about ""Safety"", and not getting Electrocuted! - This was also mentioned to the Support person.) The rest is ALL GOOD!"

3/12/2017,Amazon,3,"Good enough, but maybe not great.","I have had this trimmer for several months and it works well and holds a charge for a long time.  My old Norelco (I think) that I had for 20 years had a ring that you twisted to adjust beard length.  On this Remington, it is really hard to adjust the beard length to a specific number.  In fact, I have to put my glasses on each time I use it (you loose your length setting when you take the guide off to trim above my lip).  It has settings from 2 to 20 with only the even numbers marked.  Yes, you can adjust it to a middle (odd) number, but you have to look carefully to make sure you got it to your number.  Everything else works fine, but my old Norelco seemed more aggressive/powerful so I would just say that this one ok.  There are two settings (one faster/more powerful than the other), but I don't see a need for the slower/wimpy setting, not sure when it would be useful.  I don't use any of the special attachments, nor do I have time to fiddle with changing them out.  Oh, Ive used it in the shower a few times.  I thought this would become my new usage, since it cleans up easy.  Maybe I need to try it again in the shower but I'm afraid I need to thoroughly dry it after using it, and you definitely have to wash it off (as opposed to just shaking it off when using it dry)."

Since that was the main part I used... Not sure u can use this moving forward :/  Update 5/20/17 ... bought another one and the adjustable comb attachment broke again :/
3/18/2017,Amazon,5,Five Stars,My husband likes it a lot.
3/19/2017,Amazon,5,A surprisingly good beard /mustache trimmer.,"I purchased this to replace an aging Braun Cruzer. I have owned about 6 trimmers, and am surprised how good this trimmer is. The blade is good quality, and you can tell when you use it. It creates razor sharp lines, and cuts to the set length on the first pass over the area. Since it is advertised as waterproof, it imply that the blades must be stainless steel. The battery is great, and will not come close to being depleted after using on and off for  a half an hour. It is advertised with a 3 hour runtime, and it appears to be not far from the truth. The attachments are well designed, and hold their settings well while being used  (I've seen the length setting slip on cheap trimmers when a lot of pressure is applied). It would be nice if it came with a charging stand, but overall this is a great unit, and a bargain for the price. Recommended.  ** UPDATE ** I have been using this now for 2 weeks. The battery lasts a long time, and the motor has plenty of power. The real difference is the quality of the blades, which are excellent. I am very impressed with this trimmer. Compared with the past couple that I've owed, this is a pleasure to use, and the results are noticeably better."

That being said, it does a great job of maintaining its charge between uses. My previous Whal trimmer would loose its charge if I hadn't used it in a few weeks but that is not the case with this one. I mainly use the adjustable attachment which locks in place well. It doesn't slip down to shorter lengths when I am pressing against my face."

4/19/2017,Amazon,5,Good shaver AND BATTERY/ UPDATE 9/22/17,"UPDATE 9/22/17 Remington finally came through and replaced my shaver and after having this shaver for around a month, it works great! Battery life is now very good and have charged it only once!  I got the shaver as a replacement of an off-brand shaver I had purchased. While it worked great after the first charge, it only worked for that one use. 3 days after I had first used it, I pulled it out of my drawer to shave again and the battery was dead. Thinking I had done something wrong, I charged it again and used it that night. Two days later, the battery was dead again. The battery on this thing sucks. It does not hold a charge and will not work for more than one use without needing to be put on the charger as soon as you use it. DO NOT RECOMMEND.  UPDATE 7/29/17 I emailed them after there comment below and after 2 months no one has gotten back with me on fixing my problem. Terrible customer service once terrible battery."
4/20/2017,Amazon,5,The closest and best nose trimmer on the market in my opinion.,"You there! Have you looked around for the nose trimmer that is like this....  Wahl Lithium Micro Groomsman Trimmer #5640-1001  but you're tired of the triple A batteries running out? See that little head that has 2 of the same heads that the other product usually has? That's right, this is the nasal weed whacker you've been wanting.  It shaves just as close, if not closer, than the other product, and even even gets those tricky hairs.  That particular head is smaller than the other product and therefore easier to move around in there.  ""But what about the other attachments?""  The bigger wider head for trimming is just as good as my Wahl Peanut.  The small foil one works great for getting under the nose.  The other small head for trimming....I really don't see any point in it honestly.  I didn't want to spend all $44 for a roll of the dice to see if yet another nose trimmer that was rechargeable would come as close as the other product, but I will buy this again in a heartbeat if mine ever dies."

5/13/2017,Amazon,2,Underwhelming as a beard trimmer,"If I had to sum up the PG6170 ""Crafter"" detail trimmer in one word, it would be: Underwhelming. This trimmer would not cut my short (1/2 inch) beard cleanly, even when using turbo speed and making repeated multiple passes. I found the included small detail head to be completely useless. In fact, I was convinced the factory forgot to install both blades on the little attachment, so I inspected it under a magnifying glass. To my surprise there were two blades, so I don't understand why it wouldn't cut. The small foil shaver did work, but it left bumps on my neck. The ear and nose trimmer, on the other hand, was phenomenal. I was very pleased with that attachment. I would have kept the entire kit just for that little trimmer alone, but I couldn't justify paying $48 bucks for a nose hair trimmer…especially when what I really needed was a beard trimmer. I can't comment on the waterproof functionality, as I only used it in a dry environment. So, after suffering through a couple of very disappointing uses, I returned the PG6170 ""Crafter"" detail kit.  I then bought the Remington MB4045A ""Beardsman"" kit as a replacement for the PG6170. Whoa, what a night-and-day difference! The MB4045A is a true beard trimmer. It works really well, and I am extremely pleased with it. Too bad it didn't come with an ear/nose trimmer attachment!"
5/14/2017,Amazon,5,Feels solid in the hand and I really like the fact that it is waterproof,I've had it for a few months now and it's well made.  Feels solid in the hand and I really like the fact that it is waterproof.  I also like the nose hair attachment design better than the tube like spinners.  This one allows better control.  The case that comes with it is also a cloth material and not some cheap plastic bag that tears after 2 uses.  Very happy with this purchase.

5/15/2017,Amazon,1,Do not waste your time on this product,"Used less than a dozen times over the span of two months. No longer holds a charge. Do not waste your time on this product, quality is malarkey."
5/15/2017,Amazon,5,"Works Great, HIghly Recommended, Very Happy","After using this for about seven months now I am happy to give this 5 Stars. The batteries last forever, the blades don't pull my beard, it works great on both low power and high power settings, it works great on both my facial hair and when I shave my head. The case and zipper are sturdy, as is the how the charger plugs into the trimmer, and the and charger cord itself is sturdy. The guide attachments are solid and don't break. They attach and detach firmly and work well. It trims both to shorten and to take all the way off, as well as being able to trim up and shape my beard nicely. I've been using trimmers for a long, long time and this is the nicest one I've had so far. Highly recommended."
5/21/2017,Amazon,5,Works great!,Every attachment you could need. Love that it is cordless.
5/22/2017,Amazon,2,Needs help,"The product worked great as long as it had the original charge. The charger doesn't work at all which means the machine no longer works. It was a birthday present for my husband, and he hasn't been able to use it more than a half dozen times."
5/23/2017,Amazon,5,"Great, very satisfied",Does it's job for a very reasonable price.
5/24/2017,Amazon,5,Works great. Lots of options for trimming,"Works great.  Lots of options for trimming.  Battery charge lasts a very long time, which is great."
5/26/2017,Amazon,5,Five Stars,Works great
5/27/2017,Amazon,5,Must have for the beard game,Awesome product. I shave my head so of course I gotta grow the beard and keep it well groomed. This is exactly what I wanted and needed for the price. I don't go all crazy in the detail so it's fine for trimming and blending. I recommend it to everyone. I've only charged it once in 7 weeks and I use it every two day or lease.
5/29/2017,Amazon,5,Five Stars,great grooming tool
5/31/2017,Amazon,1,Broke after 2 months,"Have had this for two months and it's already broken. It turns on by itself and won't turn off. Also, I have to repeatedly press the button to get it on after I've finally gotten it off by plugging it in."
6/1/2017,Amazon,5,Five Stars,Works great. Would buy again.
6/3/2017,Amazon,5,good value,works great for the money
6/13/2017,Amazon,5,10/10 would buy again!,"This is the first beard trimmer I've bought. I have been growing my beard out for about 18 months without cutting it at all and I finally decided to trim it, so I bought this. I used the adjustable comb guide and set it to 20 (20mm or 0.787in or 25/32) and it did a great job trimming. It didn't get caught up or pull the hair at all. I also used some of the other attachments for some detailing. This felt very solid in my hand and changing out the attachment was a snap... or should I say twist. I do wish that I could have gotten 25mm or 1in length but overall I'm very happy. My wife said I went from looking like a caveman to a lumberjack, which I can only assume is a complement."
6/13/2017,Amazon,5,Great Product and Customer Service!,"I paid $29.71 for the PG6171 groom kit and started using it on Mar 24th. After 82 days of almost daily use it finally needed its first charge. Almost 3 months on one charge works for me. Selling points were the low price, mostly positive reviews, the useful attachments, and that the product is cordless, waterproof, and has a long-lasting lithium battery.  I found the product easy to use and maintain. I have a full beard. I use the minifoil shaver almost daily to clean up my cheeks and neck. I use the 6mm 1/4"" guide comb on the wide trimmer for the sides and jawline and the 20mm adjustable guide comb for trimming under my chin. The 3mm 1/8"" guide comb is perfect for my eyebrows, and the nose and ear trimmer does its job well too.  For maintenance, I clean the groomer and attachments with a small brush after each use, and every few weeks I put a little cutter oil on the blades, turn the groomer on and off, and wipe off any excess oil. Since the groomer is waterproof, I also occasionally rinse the product under warm water as recommended by Remington.  I did have one problem that was quickly resolved by Ann at Remington Customer Support. One day I noticed the metal foil on the shaver had a sharp edge because it had split on one side. I sent a message to customer support through their website, and they immediately sent me a replacement minifoil shaver with no questions asked.  The foil on the shaver is very delicate, so treat it carefully to avoid accidentally crushing it with your thumb or finger when you twist the shaver head on and off the groomer. An improvement would be a protective plastic foil cover, but since Remington replaced the part promptly I have absolutely no complaints and gladly rate this product with 5 stars."
6/14/2017,Amazon,5,Five Stars,The best shaver I've had. Will buy again when/if it needs to be replaced after a few years.
6/14/2017,Amazon,5,Five Stars,Love it.
6/25/2017,Amazon,5,This is pretty much perfect.,"Works great. The beard trimmer lengths are a good solid range-- everything you need and very few useless attachments. The battery lasts a very, very long time. I charge maybe once a month, if that. Noise level is good. I'm not sure why there's two speeds-- I use high speed for everything and I have a sneaking suspicion that ""normal"" speed is more about showing off how much faster high speed is. But it's so easy to use that this is forgivable. Cleaning it is a snap. If there was any change I'd make, it would be to put the power cord's brick in the middle of the cord, rather than on the plug itself.  I'd absolutely choose this one again. I probably won't have to, though, since I've had this for about a year now and it's working as well as the day I got it."
6/25/2017,Amazon,5,Best trimmer I've ever owned,Best trimmer I've ever owned. Powerfull and cordless. Quick charge and does an excellent job. Love that you can use it wet or dry. I sometimes use this instead of shaving to give my face a break.

It started having trouble turning on after about a month, maybe taking a few clicks to get it going. But now it won't turn on at all. Very disappointed in the life of the product since it was rather expensive."

7/3/2017,Amazon,1,Do not waste your money.,"I have had this for 1 year. It never performed the way it was supposed to, but I needed it immediately and used it.  It would not hold a charge for very long.  Soon after a full charge and using it the unit would blink low battery.  Now, less than a year later, it holds zero charge and is unusable!"
7/4/2017,Amazon,1,Don't buy this product,Quit working after 3 months! Do not buy this product.
7/6/2017,Amazon,5,This one works fine. Like the large comb for trimming my beard ...,"Needed a replacement for an older model.  This one works fine.  Like the large comb for trimming my beard to the size I want, not the size of a particular small comb."
7/7/2017,Amazon,2,much like the other remington products i've tried,"much like the other remington products i've tried, it doesn't get a close enough shave for trimming wild hairs or neckline.  You have to go over and over the same spot causing a rash.  I had to return it"
7/8/2017,Amazon,1,"Worked great, but I expect to get years out of ...","Nine months later and it won't recharge. Worked great, but I expect to get years out of one of these, or at least be able to use it plugged in."

7/16/2017,Amazon,1,Returned it,Didn't work as good as the ones we've purchased in the past on my husband's finer back neck hair. Extremely annoying since that is why we purchased it!
7/18/2017,Amazon,1,Terrible components. Broke after 8 months.,"The plastic shield used for beard trimming (the main attachment) broke after less than a year. Really poorly constructed. The shaver itself is nice, but today I'm the proud accidental owner of my first baby face in 5 years thanks to this little piece of garbage."
7/20/2017,Amazon,5,I recremend this to anyone,I have had several different brands and this particular one is the best I have had by far.
7/22/2017,Amazon,5,Five Stars,Works very well.
7/23/2017,Amazon,5,Five Stars,Fantastic
7/23/2017,Amazon,2,"As a beard trimmer, it was a disappointment.","I bought this because I liked the idea of having something I could use for my beard, as well as having the extra attachments. As a ear and nose hair trimmer, it works fantastic. It's also good when you use the blade with no guard.  The problem I have with this is as a beard trimmer. Honestly, using words like ""Beard Boss"" would lead me to believe it would work well to trim my beard down to a good length. The unfortunate reality is that as a beard trimmer it is not very good. I've been using it for about 9 months, and it has been extremely frustrating. Today when I was using it, I got close to the mirror and could see that when the blades made contact with my beard hair (specifically grey hairs) it wouldn't cut them. Instead, it would just push the hair over.  I would not recommend this product."
7/23/2017,Amazon,5,Great product,Excellent trimmer
7/23/2017,Amazon,5,Five Stars,Absolutely fantastic for nose hair removal.
7/26/2017,Amazon,3,If you have thicker body hair this will not do ...,If you have thicker body hair this will not do the trick. It is a decent little beard trimmer but nothing else.
7/27/2017,Amazon,4,Good trimmer,"good trimmer, but have to return because sometimes I can't stop it, after turbo mode it switches to regular mode again. the rest is awesome, It is waterproof and shaves clean. Overall I like it."
7/27/2017,Amazon,5,Best Trimmer,Spent a lot of time researching beard trimmers and kept coming back to this one. I am glad I made the decision to order this trimmer. It has attachments for anything that you need to trim and cleans very easily.
7/27/2017,Amazon,3,Blades not that sharp,"Blades seem to get dull after a couple of uses, going to buy something more on the professional side of things."

8/7/2017,Amazon,1,Will not hold charge after a few uses.,"It seemed to work well at first - charged it overnight, used it until the charge ran out.  Now, it will not hold a charge (this after only a couple of months and probably 3-4 uses).  I missed the return window since he doesn't trim his beard super regularly.  Total bummer- waste of $40."
8/7/2017,Amazon,1,Low quality,The razor itself seems ok but the plastic adjustable main attachment began to fall apart after 5 uses. After about 10 total the button came off completely despite never being dropped it mishandled in any way. It is now completely useless for my needs.
8/8/2017,Amazon,5,Happy with this!,Seems to be a great trimmer. I bought this s a gift.
8/8/2017,Amazon,4,The best shaver I've ever owned,The best shaver I've ever owned. It comes with so many great attachments you didn't think you would need until you started using them. It looks and feel great and doesn't leave me with razor bumps/burns. Best of all is its turbo feature that does amazing work!
8/10/2017,Amazon,4,Not too close of a shave without the attachment.,I like the product. Thought the trimmer by itself might get a little closer of a shave but so far so good.
8/11/2017,Amazon,1,I love it except it randomly turns on and the power button is not responsive.,8/11/17 - I still love it except it randomly turns on and the power button is not responsive. Sometimes I need to mash the power button 5 times before it starts responding. I definitely have a defective unit and I'm out of the return window. I contacted Remington and if they are able to fix this I'll gladly update my review.  I have tried many electric trimmers over the years and all failed to cut my thick scraggly beard consistently due to half my hairs loving to sit close to my face and the others sticking straight out. Because this shaver is waterproof I've learned to thoroughly wet and wash my face which helps to lift my hairs off my face. The shaver then powers right through it all while minimally having to go over the same spots compared to the multitude of other shavers I've had. Highly recommended.
8/15/2017,Amazon,5,Five Stars,The shaver works great! Long battery life and really easy to use
8/17/2017,Amazon,5,Good for the price,Does it's job pretty well. I like how it has a #0

8/21/2017,Amazon,5,Great buy,"It was a gift for my husband and he says, it's one of the best products like this that he's owned and with the various heads, he can achieve the varied looks he wants"
8/24/2017,Amazon,5,great trimmer with attachments and holds a charge forever,This trimmer was a great purchase. I had a Norelco before that was not performing as expected (unable to get a close beard trim) and wouldn't hold a charge after about a year.  The reason I like this one so well is the various attachments make it easy to get different beard or body hair lengths from very short to fairly long.  This trimmer holds a charge for a very long time and you can get hours of use out of full charge.  I use it about once a week for beard trimming and have used it once or twice for chest and back trimming and I am still on the original charge after 2-3 months.  I have had a few different trimmers and so far this one is my favorite especially when the price is considered.
8/26/2017,Amazon,5,Happy customer!,"This thing has worked great for me! I bought it so I could keep my beard trimmed during a long trip oversees. I was hoping that I could also use it to buzz my head every once and a while, and to my surprise it totally did that job as well! Its still working great months later, and I use it at least 2 times per week. I don't feel like I have to charge it very often and it totally does the job :)"
8/26/2017,Amazon,5,Good shaver. I especially like the style of the ...,Good shaver.  I especially like the style of the nose and ear trimmer.  I normally keep a short shadow beard and this trimmer keeps it low.

I'm requesting the company to check their equipments before sending it out to the customers, so we don't have to deal with contacting You and Amazon frequently."

Screenshot your Amazon order and send it to them and they will replace the unit.  Upgrade review to 3 stars for Remington Customer support."
9/26/2017,Amazon,5,Almost 2 years! It still holds it's charge and trims amazingly well!,"I have had this Beard Trimmer for the past 20 months, and I use it every other day to maintain my facial hair. I have not had any issues with this trimmer and would highly recommend it. Battery life on it is great even with heavy usage I only need to charge it every other week and with its waterproof construction cleaning it is just a matter of rinsing all the parts off in the sink and letting them sit to dry. The adjustable length blade guard and large trimmer are what I use almost exclusively with the occasional use of the detail trimmer and the blades show no sign of wearing down.  I thought I would miss the vacuum feature off my old Phillips Norelco Trimmer, but cleaning up a few extra hairs in the sink really doesn't add that much time to my routine and this trimmer offers more flexibility with all the additional attachments if you need them."

9/29/2017,Amazon,5,This is what Whal used to be.,I have been using Whal trimmers for 30 years or so.  And every 3-4 years when I buy a new one.  With each new Wahl purchase the quality would decline.

10/8/2017,Amazon,5,Wonderful razor!,"I have used many different electric razors throughout my life and Remington has far exceeded their competitors. This has made the chore of shaving far less of an obnoxious task that I loathe.

Last one I bought was a Phillips/Norelco model with, for some stupid reason, a laser light; this Remington model is less expensive and far superior.  Quiet, lightweight, and maneuverable so you get a very even cut including around uneven parts of your face.  And it takes much less time to trim, because you go over an area once, and it is just right the first time.  Buy it!"

11/5/2017,Amazon,2,Beautiful then nothing,For the first 3months of use it was really good but it must be charged for at least 15-20 min to shave not as described for 5 min to complete the shave but I dealt with it as It couldn’t be returned after that it stopped working without any prior notice just not working.so this was my experience with remington i think I will not buy this brand again
11/6/2017,Amazon,2,Very disappointing,"I've  had a Remington trimmer similar to this for many years and have loved it.  However, I wanted one for my girlfriend's house and purchased this.

11/24/2017,Amazon,1,Not enough power to cut thick beards,"I just ordered this and used it the first time to trim back a very overgrown beard as my last trimmer from 5 years ago had broken a while ago. In turbo mode the motor didn't seem to have enough power to cut through very thick hair.  It just bogged down really hard and wouldn't cut well in some areas. To achieve a cut I had to comb and pass over the same area fifteen or twenty times to get an even trim in my beard. After I was finished the blades were scalding hot, and that cannot be a good thing. However this item does work well in the shower and on the body. This being said I still rate one star for the name ""beard boss"" yet the motor lacks enough torque to power through very thick beard hair."
11/25/2017,Amazon,1,Stops working suddenly.,Stopped working under one year. I did not use it any more then 10 times and it no longer works.

11/30/2017,Amazon,4,Good value,"This replaced an older off-brand unit that lasted years.  The price was good however so if I can get 2 years out of it it won't be a total waste.  Build quality is ""OK""."
12/1/2017,Amazon,5,Amazing craftsmanship!,Have been using an old Remington shaver. Purchased this one on a deals day and was pleasantly surprised! All the attachements work wonderfully and hold on to the machine part very well. I am a hairy guy and this thing handles my beard very well and gives me the ability to style it if I wish.
12/5/2017,Amazon,5,Great detailing set!,The arrangement of attachments are great!  My husband loves this set for his detailed grooming!
12/6/2017,Amazon,5,Five Stars,Love the fact that there are so many lengths that can be chosen.
12/7/2017,Amazon,5,Five Stars,"So far so good. Many pieces, but they are all labeled well."
12/8/2017,Amazon,5,Five Stars,It has worked well so far. I hope it continues!
12/12/2017,Amazon,2,Doesn't hold a charge,"Strangest thing... the product itself works great, when it's charged. The problem, the charge drains when it's not in use. I charge it, and if it's in the drawer for a couple days, not in use, it dies. Next issue, you can't just plug it in and use it in the moment. You have to wait for it to charge... so, I have to decide a couple hours before I'm using it that I intend to and then plug it in. Or I have to keep it plugged in all the time. It's extremely frustrating.  It wasn't that way in the beginning. It worked normally for about 6 months.  Wouldn't buy it again."
12/12/2017,Amazon,1,Remington guys are top notch swindlers and dishonest people,Very very very poor product. Completely fooled me. I bought it looking at reviews. Was supposed to be water proof. Now it's stopped working. It's not even switching on. Shocked by this and I can't even return. Will never buy from these guys again. Ran out of juice within 2 months and the return window is closed. Terribly irresponsible by the company. I had to trim for an interview today and thanks to them I was looking like a yeti. Thank you so much for that
12/16/2017,Amazon,1,One Star,The ear and nose hair trimmer attachment doesn’t work. One of the main reasons this item was bought

1/13/2018,Amazon,1,Broke within 6 months!,"I bought this shaver in July 2017 and it worked great until last month. Now the battery loses charge after about 15 minutes. Once the battery loses charge, it turns itself on randomly and won't turn off. The on/off button is impossible to manipulate. I would not waste your money on this shaver."
1/13/2018,Amazon,1,6 months of use and died very unhappy about product!,purchased end of May! totally just stopped working!

The charge lasts a very long time:  I use this twice a week, and I have only had to charge it once since I received it in early October 2017.  I really appreciate the fact that it is water proof, as it makes it easier to clean.  I also find the adjustable-length attachment to be very sturdy, and it stays put very reliably during the shave."
1/19/2018,Amazon,5,works great. Comes already charged,works great. Comes already charged. Got it for my boyfriend and he loves the variety of size clips. Very quiet.

1/23/2018,Amazon,5,Top of the Line,"Very happy with this product and the different options it presents.  My previous pair of clippers didn't provide an even shave around the goatee area, but this set is spot on.  Could not be happier."
1/23/2018,Amazon,5,... product for over a year and it still works great.,My husband has used this product for over a year and it still works great.
1/27/2018,Amazon,2,Looks good but performance is not what I expected,"While the accessories are nice, the power of the device is lacking.  Following the instructions I charged it as directed.  The trimmer is a 2 speed device.  Power was nothing like my old remington I had, it was replaced because it wouldn't hold a charge anymore.  Trimmer is well built but it just doesn't suit my needs.  I would not buy this again.  Would return it but I was so sure that I would like it after the reviews I didn't keep the packaging it was sent in.  I guess live and learn.  Ordered another brand today, will keep packaging this time."
1/30/2018,Amazon,5,Keeps my wife happy!,I love this. I use the razor and attachments regularly. Well made and very versatile.
1/31/2018,Amazon,1,One Star,Terrible. Variable size fitting broke within the first use. Do not recommend.
1/31/2018,Amazon,4,Great value with tons of accessories,"Great value. Gets everything you need done. Only thing that could be improved is when you try to shave your face smooth. It’s hard to really get that baby skin smooth shave, but maybe I’m doing something wrong."

2/8/2018,Amazon,1,Worked less than 6 weeks!,"I gave this to my 18 year old son for Christmas and 6 weeks later it has stopped charging and is useless. Unfortunately, I bought it in July so I can't even return it. Very disappointed."

2/18/2018,Amazon,5,Great trimmer,Bought this for my husband. He was wanting a new trimmer so we purchased this one. Great quality and holds a good charge. It came as described and as pictured. I would highly recommend this!
2/18/2018,Amazon,5,Great beard trimmer that has more going for it than the comparable Wahl.,"I've tried many beard trimmers over the years, most recently the Wahl Stainless Steel Lithium Ion Plus Wahl Clipper Stainless Steel Lithium Ion Plus Beard Trimmers for Men, Hair Clippers and Shavers, Nose Ear Trimmers, Rechargeable All in One Men's Grooming Kit, by the Brand used by Professionals #9818.  Here's how they compare: --Both have good battery life.  I was able to get several uses in before having to charge either --Both come with all the combs and guides you'll need.  The Remington has an adjustable guide for the longer settings, so if you don't like sorting through a lot of combs, the Remington has an edge there. --The Wahl tended to pull my hair. The Remington doesn't pull at all. --The Remington provided a slightly closer shave with no comb attached. --The Remington is lighter, but still feels solid. --The Remington has two speeds.  I always use the higher, turbo speed which seems about the equivalent of the Wahl speed --The Remington is water proof so you can use it in the shower, the Wahl is not --The Remington is about $10 cheaper  All in all, I'm quite happy with the trim I get from the Remington.  I trim about once a week and am not after a clean shave, and for that frequency and type of trim, it works great."
2/18/2018,Amazon,5,Thank you!!!,"He loves it.  His only regret is that he suffered with his old unit for too long, if he had known how nice this Remington was going to make his life... Thank you!!!"

2/27/2018,Amazon,5,Five Stars,Excellent product
2/27/2018,Amazon,5,Love it very clean cut,Love this thing although it does nip if you are cutting on sensitive skin
2/28/2018,Amazon,5,Great shaver,The battery life is great. All the attachments work great. The smaller size is nice for precision detail.
2/28/2018,Amazon,5,Five Stars,Great item as expected.
3/1/2018,Amazon,4,"Best feeling trimmer for the price, longevity has yet to prove itself.","So far this has been a great product, but so were others I spent less, as much as, and more on, until they weren't.  Not all of the heads are functional, but the primary one is. I don't understand the point of the lower setting, any adult male that uses this is going to coarser facial hair than the lower setting can contend with, and if you forget to double tap the button, expect a few sharp pains as the hair is pulled from your face, not trimmed.  That said, it's sleek, it holds a charge forever, and it's well sealed so I believe it is totally shower viable for the long haul if you double your trimmers as body hair groomers.  I'll certainly update if the experience goes south."
3/2/2018,Amazon,5,"Well Made, Excellent Tool",Outstanding product.  So many uses.
3/3/2018,Amazon,5,Five Stars,so far so good
3/4/2018,Amazon,4,Solid beard trimmer!,"This is a pretty good little trimmer. The battery lasts good long while, over multiple shaves. It is also nice to have simple combs for length, you never have to worry about a slip on an adjustable trimmer and have your beard get accidentally trimmed too short. I only wish the foil was wider. If I was using it for my whole face it would take forever, but I only use it for my neck below my beer in line for extra fancy occasions. Other than that it’s a perfect tool for a manly man with a manly beard wake me  I only wish the foil was wider.

3/5/2018,Amazon,1,Don't buy if you have curly hair,"After my last shaver broke, I was really excited to pick up this set. The description was incredibly promising and I expected a quick and easy shave. That was not the case. This thing is clearly not designed for someone with even moderately curly hair. From the glowing description of this product it should be more than capable of handling less than a week old facial growth of medium-tight curly hair. It didn't come close.  The shaver has two power modes, but the regular mode isn't useful at all. It felt like the battery dying on my old shaver. I had to shave completely in the ""boost"" mode they advertised... it would be better called ""not dead battery"" mode. Almost immediately into my shave the adjustable guard became completely clogged. I've used other shavers with adjustable guards before and haven't had this issue. I had to do multiple passes on a less than one week old beard, completely removing the guard and cleaning it multiple times a pass. Even still it wasn't cutting evenly and left my face looking patchy. I also tried to completely remove a mustache and under-lip hair with the mesh shaving guard. It also wasn't able to make it through my hair, a problem I've never had before.  This definitely isn't a shaver I could ever rely on, very much regretting spending any money on it."

This new trimmer is awesome! It's compact but not too small for my large hands. I like the two speeds, although I really only use the fastest speed (not sure why you would need the slow speed). The nose trimmer is...interesting, but I did use it and it didn't cut me or anything so that's a win! The beard trimmer slider thing works well too. It's a bit difficult to choose the correct length setting, but once you get it locked in it does stay without sliding. I hope this trimmer lasts me years and years like the last one because I like it a lot!"

3/27/2018,Amazon,2,Worked well for about a year,"Used this every two weeks to trim my beard for the past year.  The device itself still works well and holds a charge, but the large guard that came with it was made out of cheap plastic and broke.  I can still use it for some things, but not trimming my beard.  Make the guards as sturdy as the trimmer or it’s worthless unless you want a buzz cut."

4/1/2018,Amazon,2,A disappointment,"The detail foil shaver began to malfunction after the first shave. I opened it to remove the hair within and put it back together. It now makes a terrible rattling sound and doesn't work anymore.

4/17/2018,Amazon,4,"Cuts very well, lots of useful accessories","For many years I used a Philips beard trimmer with a vacuum, but my second one died so I decided to try this Remington. It does cut very well - the blades move faster than the Philips did - but I do miss the vacuum feature. I use one of the fixed-depth combs which works well for me, though the adjustable comb clicks securely into place. I also appreciate and use the small trimmer (for my mustache) and the ear/nose trimmer. It's also nice that a carry bag is included.  The only thing I don't like is that the trimmer will not run if the AC cord is connected and plugged in, but that's a minor gripe. It supposedly charges quickly."
4/19/2018,Amazon,1,Very Poor Quality,"Purchased this item at the end of Feb. 2018. It is half-way through April, and it is making a noise that would preclude anyone from putting it anywhere near their face. You get what you pay for."

5/5/2018,Amazon,5,Good trimmer.,works fine.
5/6/2018,Amazon,2,All great except for the the plastic on top that controls the length which can easily go shorter by accident while you trim,The trimmer itself works fine and the battery last long but the plastic on top that you use to choose the length is poorly designed... It doesn't hold well and while I was shaving as usual with length 12 it suddenly pushed inside and got me a short square on my beard... Very unpleasant! Now I really need to hold it carefully with my hand because it is really loose.

One charge has lasted him 4 trim-ups which last 20-30 minutes each ---and it still hasnt lost it's charge.  The beard/length attachment is really well put together,  it has 2-20 length settings on 1 attachment instead of on a bunch of different ones like I've gotten in the past.  Great buy, would recommend."
5/13/2018,Amazon,5,Great product for the price,Great product for the price! The trimmer and attachments are well built and sturdy. This should easily last a few years.

5/17/2018,Amazon,5,Works like if should,"My rechargable trimmer died. So I did my research and ordered this one. I also have a Wahl electric trimmer to keep my mostly bald head closely cropped and a nose ear trimmer. I put these two away because the Remmington works so much better. The blades are sharper than the Wahl where several passes were needed with the Wahl and it still missed hairs. All of the attachments work smoothly and go on and off the trimmer easily. The pieces that snap on do so tightly. The Wahl’s fall off constantly. The foil shaver actually works. The ear, nose trimmer doesn’t pull hairs. The detail trimmer can take care of ears like none of the three others I had. It looks nice, feels nice and holds a charge so I don’t have to keep it sitting out on the charger constantly. I put it away until I need it again. And it can also be used in the shower. This was exactly what I was looking for. And I very seldom write a review, especially a positive one!"

5/21/2018,Amazon,1,NOT WATERPROOF BROKE IN 5 months.,Used his product 7 times. Only needed to charge it once. I used this trimmer in the shower to shorten my facial hair before using a razor blade. I bought it for the sole reason it was water proof. The buzzer light burnt out and the buzzer would come on or stay on when I wanted to shut it off. I have charged this product. I don’t believe this product is waterproof.

5/24/2018,Amazon,5,and I'm delighted with what I got,"At my age, I've had many beard trimmers from each of the major brands. When my last one stopped taking a charge, I went back on the web and found this Beard Boss model. Made the switch from Wahl to Remington, and I'm delighted with what I got. I've only used it once, but it was easily far superior to my last trimmer. The guides go on/off MUCH easier than with the Wahl, and I'm not worried about breaking them. Others have commented that there's no need for both speeds, but I find that the lower speed was better for me when using the nose hair removal attachment. Can't comment on how long this one will last, because I just got it. But my first impressions are ALL positive. One funny thing: I was trying to register the device on Reminton's webpage and couldn't get it to work for me. Emailed them and got the most refreshingly honest response. In essence, I was told how to do it, but reminded that all I really needed to do was keep the receipt and then a confession: the registration on the web thing is really just a marketing thing. LOL  Anyway - five stars easily on this product. I'm quite pleased."

And charges very quickly! * It shaves well - never any nicks but shaves close, for a trimmer, and compact, easy to get to where I need. * Nifty attachments - nose and ear trimmer design is really good, works well. I haven't tried the foil head, curious about that. * I found a simple arrangement that gets the length I want for my partial beard, but there's a lot of options including an adjustable head if you need. * Compact - easy to include in my travel kit, even with charging cord (which I usually don't need). * Seems kinda bullet-proof simple. The blade assembly doesn't have space to gather residue, so little or no cleaning is required.  The general quality of operation together with the extreme run between charging, topped off with the compactness and generally fine design and accessories makes it a real win, and this an unreserved recommendation."
6/8/2018,Amazon,5,Impressively quiet,My favorite trimmer so far. I have owned too many to count. Close shave and actually really quiet. The noise output is impressively low. Very happy with my purchase.
6/10/2018,Amazon,5,Five Stars,Works great so far

6/23/2018,Amazon,5,Five Stars,Nice set and still running great! Easy to clean. Doesn't get hot.
6/24/2018,Amazon,5,I like the two speeds,"Very impressive trimmer. I like the two speeds. Very nice grip. I can’t attest to the durability just yet because I have only had it for a couple months, but it seams very well built"

6/27/2018,Amazon,5,My wife uses it too,Works just as expected. And my wife uses it too...let me just say it gave great results.
6/27/2018,Amazon,5,Great trimmer,Works great
7/4/2018,Amazon,5,just what I needed my other trimmer did not work ...,just what I needed my other trimmer did not work any more so time for a new one and this one as more attachments
7/5/2018,Amazon,3,Three Stars,"the machine works well, but plastic adjustable attachment broke after only a few months.  seriously limits ability to use."
7/7/2018,Amazon,1,"Died in 6 months, Remington not honoring two year warranty","I've had this shaver for less than a year. A few weeks ago, it started to randomly turn itself on. Eventually it drained its battery. It no longer charges or turns on. I contacted Remington for warranty replacement:  Feb 8th, Sent initial warranty claim email Feb 8th, Recv'd response asking for serial # Feb 8th, Sent serial # Feb 11th, Recv'd response asking for name and address Feb 11th, Sent name and address  It is now Feb 23. I have not heard back in 12 days, and it has been 15 since the initial warranty request."
7/10/2018,Amazon,5,"Worthy, but not necessary","I had the cheaper remington version and loved it, however after about 2 years my foil shaver was getting noticeably ""choppy"" so I needed to replace it. I looked around, honestly remington has the two best products so I found myself choosing between that one and this one. In the past two years I have graduated college and have a nice job so I figured I would try the more expensive one. Let me say, it does feel nice. It definitely looks and feels like a mature product. The only useful benefit over the cheaper option is the nose trimmer attachment.  If you do not care about having ""fancy"" looks and the nose trimmer attachment, just get the cheaper one. It is the exact same mostly and lasted me quite some time. If you want an upgraded appearance/feel with the nose trimmer, get this one. Ultimately, I decided it was worth being able to consolidate all my grooming into one tool, and I wanted the more mature look. I do not regret my purchase at all, however I would be content with the cheaper one had this not been in the budget."
7/11/2018,Amazon,5,Five Stars,great buy
7/11/2018,Amazon,5,All-in-one groomer with a lot of versatility,Purchased for my son to trim up his beard and keep it neat and clean.  He loves the versatility of all the different guards.  It is an all-in-one groomer.
7/14/2018,Amazon,3,OK but the adjustable head doen't hold up/,did not take long until the adjustable spacer would no longer stay where you set it.
7/15/2018,Amazon,3,OK for Beards...NOT A RAZOR!,"OK for Beards...NOT A RAZOR! If you want to clean and trip and/or grow a beard, then it is OK. If you want to SHAVE, then NOT recommended! I have a beard and it works well to shape and keep a consistent length BUT to shave my neck or cheek, it SUCKS!!!! Horrible RAZOR for ""skin jobs."""
7/21/2018,Amazon,5,The nose hair trimmer is very good and gets up into the nostril well,"This works well for close trimming my facial hair, and not so close trimming some body hair.  Cuts well, and the battery lasts a long time.  The nose hair trimmer is very good and gets up into the nostril well.  Great value."
7/26/2018,Amazon,5,Best beard clippers I've used,"This thing kicks ass. Best beard clippers I've used, and can even use them while in the shower, since it's water proof. Titanium head on the main set of clippers should last a while. Hopefully the battery gives me very good life holding charges before it needs replacing. Dual settings for normal and fast clipping. Works great on my face and for maintaining my nether regions, which the ladies seem to like. Definitely recommend."
7/28/2018,Amazon,5,3 year battery life! Not too shabby!,Mine lasted 3 years. Great trimmer! Only charged it 6 or 7 times. Love using it in the shower. Only wish the attachments were rubber or metal so they won't break if it slips out of your hand.

8/4/2018,Amazon,5,Best ever,I love it. Best one I've ever had.
8/4/2018,Amazon,5,Five Stars,Ecellent
8/6/2018,Amazon,2,Would not charge less than 6 months later,Worked well the first few months but the battery will not charge anymore. Expected more for the price.
8/14/2018,Amazon,4,Four Stars,Good Product. Easy to use.
8/15/2018,Amazon,5,Really does a great job,my grandson is thrilled
8/15/2018,Amazon,4,Very pleased with this trimmer.  Accurate and effective.,"I use this to trim my beard and mustache.  Compared to a Norelco trimmer I bought a year or so ago, this one is far better.  The Norelco had a vacuum built in but that made it too big and bulky at the head to trim under the nose, clean up the mustache, etc and it just didn't do a good job of getting stray hairs or reducing bulk.  To be fair, it was a bit different setup that did not have various trimmer heads like this Remington.  This trimmer is great.  Two speeds.  The main trimmer attachment works great for shaping and does a great job of reducing bulk using one of the attachable black combs.  I like the separate black ones better than the clear adjustable one.  Much easier to see what I'm doing with the smaller pop-on black ones.  The small detail trimmer is great for stray hairs under the nose and for trimming mustache along your upper lip and beard below your lower lip.  The little foil shaver didn't do much for me and I have not tried the nose/ear/eyebrow trimmer yet, as I don't have any bushes growing out of those areas yet and my eyebrows don't look like Abe Vigoda's.  I'm very happy with this trimmer and the price was great-about $32 with the 20% off coupon."
8/22/2018,Amazon,5,Great buy.,Just what we needed. Does just what it said it would
8/23/2018,Amazon,5,It's a good product and keeps a person looking tidy and trim.,"Perfect for trimming beard, mustache, inside nostrils, and inside ears.  It's a good product and keeps a person looking tidy and trim."
8/27/2018,Amazon,5,Five Stars,They work great just what I expected.
8/29/2018,Amazon,5,Great for ladies,"Use it to trim my bikini line and pit hair, high quality trimmer, more durable than women's products, and no gimmicks!~"
9/2/2018,Amazon,2,Battery will give out after 6 months,"Bought this item a few months ago. After about 4 charges, the battery gave out and it would malfunction repeatedly. The Trimmer would stay on for hours and would not turn off no matter how many times i pressed the power button. I would not purchase again."
9/4/2018,Amazon,5,You can buy replacement parts,It’s fast and easy
9/10/2018,Amazon,3,Great while it lasted.,Great while it was working. Tons of options. Died in a little under a year. Takes a charge but doesn't turn on.
9/12/2018,Amazon,5,Nice job Remington!,Quiet and works great
9/12/2018,Amazon,5,Great stuff,This works great to keep my beard looking clean and it also works well with other body hair
9/15/2018,Amazon,5,Great Buy,Got this on a deal during Prime Day. Works perfect for any part of your body...yes...any part...LoL
9/22/2018,Amazon,5,Perfect trimmer!,"My husband loves this and so do I! I bought this initially to trim the back of his hair when I give him haircuts, but he uses this to trim his beard down before he shaves. He was kicking himself for not thinking of getting one of these sooner. It’s the perfect little trimmer!"
9/23/2018,Amazon,5,This is the one.,"This is the third different trimmer that I bought in two months. The first two were brand names and expensive. The one pulled a few hairs out every time I used it, ouch. The second one didn't have the adjustments that I wanted. The Remington PG6170 cuts and trims very well and has an adjustable attachments that I like. I have a mustache and a goatee that I like to keep trimmed and the Remington does the job."
9/23/2018,Amazon,1,I hate this thing.,I purchased this hoping it could replace my current razor. Instead I got something inferior and that doesn't work that well. First of all it doesn't shave very close and leaves allot of patches and stubble. Second of all it doesn't allow you to clean the heads unless you unscrew the top with a screwdriver. Save your money and buy something else.
9/27/2018,Amazon,5,Awesome seller! Very honest!,Love it!
10/2/2018,Amazon,4,DIDN'T COME WITH CHARGER!,"After using it for months, it finally died on me. I went to see if there was a charger, but it didn't come with it... I love it trimmer, but how can you forget to put a charger in the box??"
10/3/2018,Amazon,2,Dangerous device!,It started turning itself on at random! I'm afraid to have it in the house for it might start a fire!
10/4/2018,Amazon,5,Great Deal Product Works as Described,great product works as described
10/5/2018,Amazon,2,Copper attachment head great. The other’s not at all.,"I liked how the copper head shaves, it is very smooth running and without any knicks or anything along those lines but that is pretty much the only good head on it. Any other attachment is trash! Especially the foil attachment for stubble shaving. If you’re trying to get smooth skin you may want to look toward another product."
10/9/2018,Amazon,5,Good,Good
10/9/2018,Amazon,3,Good shaver when it worked.,"Was a good beard trimmer for the first year then it started acting funky. Wouldn't start on button press or it would go straight to turbo mode on button press. Sometimes it would also turn on all on it's own as well. Been doing this for the last 6 months or so and then just wouldn't come on at all this morning no matter what I tried. So figured I would try taking it apart and see if it was something that could be easily fixed like the rusting screws mentioned below. Turn's out that it wasn't quite 100% water proof/secured.  Pros: Supposedly water proof. Nice amount of attachments for the price. Long lasting battery(have never managed to run it down).  Cons: As a few people have mentioned, the screws on the trimmer rust quickly. Not too big a deal if you have a local hardware store that has screws of this size in stainless or such. As shown in the attached photo's, it's not 100% waterproof, that or I got lucky and got one that isn't. can see on the backside where the battery is, it's got stuff growing at both ends. Orange stuff on top part where the attachments connect and an aquamarine mold(by the looks of it) where you plug in the charger.  Overall: Great trimmer barring the problems above. Would recommend if above problems get fixed in a future model."
10/10/2018,Amazon,4,Good quality....but no smoothening blades,Nice product...good durability...many uses. What I don't like is that it can't make your face smooth ...just trims or removes heavy beard. I like it in general.
10/15/2018,Amazon,1,Doesn't turn off,"I was very happy with all the different functionalities after first use. However, it appears that there's a problem with the ON/OFF button. The trimmer stays on and I have no control over it, even though I'm pressing the ON/OFF button to turn it off. It took me about 5 minutes of pressing the button randomly for the trimmer to finally turn off. First use, problems already. Don't buy it. Will update my comment if customer service ends up fixing this. PS: as I was writing this review, the trimmer started working on its own, without me pressing the button."
10/15/2018,Amazon,5,Perfect,For manscaping
10/25/2018,Amazon,1,It doesn't work anymore,"I've had this trimmer since May, and it no longer works as of this week. I might use this tool once a week, so its not like its had a lot of use. It all started a couple weeks ago when the power button started acting finicky. Now, it won't turn on at all. I'll be looking for a different brand."
10/26/2018,Amazon,5,Strong and long lasting,"Strong body and durable battery. The soft grip makes this product even better and light, when using. And more importantly,Blades are very smooth."
10/27/2018,Amazon,1,"Have had two, both have had electrical/battery problems.","I received a second replacement shipment, but it too has battery and/or electrical problems.  Randomly the trimmer will power itself on.  Last night it was at 4 am, I woke up and switched it off.  About 4:30 am it powered up again, and I moved it to a different part of the house after I switched it off.  My wife said it was running again around 6:30 am.  The power button is broken after 8 months of light usage (beard trim 2x/week), maybe 65 uses? Before that, I loved it, lots of ways to maintain my beard.  Prior to it breaking, the trimmer would randomly power itself on, and once the power button became unresponsive, it was very difficult to turn off."
11/2/2018,Amazon,5,Works well,"Son likes it, works well"
11/6/2018,Amazon,3,Good as beard trimmer not so close of a shave,A little disappointing thought could use it for a close shave but it just does not work for me could work possibly well as a beard trimmer...the nose and ear hair removal tool is awesome !
11/9/2018,Amazon,5,Recommend.,Used on a weekly basis for a few years now. Have had no problems of any kind. Would buy again.
11/13/2018,Amazon,5,Works Really Great  - Great for dog paws too,Very impressed so far. Nice selection of heads for shaving hair anywhere on your body. (I'm a hairy guy) Update: I just used this to trim the hair around my dogs paws (Pomerian) Much easier and faster than using hand clippers
11/13/2018,Amazon,1,Battery is terrible,The battery has died in less than three months
11/15/2018,Amazon,1,Broke with in the month!,Broke with in the month
11/20/2018,Amazon,5,Great groomer,"I've had many electric groomers and this is the best one.  I really like the way it trims but not so happy with the height adjustment.  You can't really fine tune it and so, for me, it seems to be either too high or too close.  I do like the ear/nose trimmer attachment - beats the heck out of all the battery operated ear/nose trimmers that I've owned."
11/24/2018,Amazon,4,Works well/difficult attachments,Excellent product but exchanging accessories seems needlessly confusing.
11/25/2018,Amazon,3,Only lasts a year!,"After one year of use, the unit's on/off button stopped working. I kept it mainly on a shelf in the shower because I thought it was truly water proof but it doesn't seem so. Also the beard trimmer head's screws began to rust and the head mostly seized up. If you are aren't ok with the unit only lasting a year, I would recommend a different purchase or ensure you always keep it dry."
11/25/2018,Amazon,1,doesn't come with charger,wtf is that crap?
11/27/2018,Amazon,3,Shop around,"Like that it’s useful, but dislike that it doesn’t have all the settings that are need to trim my mustache."
11/30/2018,Amazon,5,"Really good kit, the battery of the trimmer is so amazing","it works really go, I use once per week or two weeks and since I bought (feb) I had to charge it full like 2 times, even if I use the detail trimmer frecuently."
12/3/2018,Amazon,5,In comparison to the popular Remington PG6025 All-in-1 kit...,"The Crafter: - has smaller heads with more of an angle; this is nice because it makes doing details easier. - has an LED which flashes when your battery is low. - has a turbo mode if you press the on switch again. Turbo mode is not a gimmick. Usually first I shave with the main head, and then Turbo mode over everything once to make sure everything is clean shaven. When the blade is cutting at such a high rpm it makes it glide noticeably smoother across the skin. - cuts closer to the skin with the main head. This could be because I used the PG6025 for a long time which made it dull over time, but I feel The Crafter simply does a better job of shaving. - has attachment points with a larger diameter, making them more snug when you switch a head. - makes less noise. It still makes noise, just less. - has a longer battery life. - is heavier. This isn’t a positive or negative thing to me, just something I noticed.  Because I normally maintain some sort of facial hair style, my most used head is the detail trimmer. The only thing I liked more about the PG6025 is the elongated shape of the detail trimmer is much better in my opinion; it’s a bit easier than The Crafter’s detail trimmer."
12/4/2018,Amazon,5,Awesome!,Perfect buy!
12/9/2018,Amazon,5,Excellent Choice,Very impressed overall with this trimmer. I shopped around quite a bit before deciding on this model. No regrets whatsoever.
12/10/2018,Amazon,5,Well worth it,Awesome product
12/11/2018,Amazon,5,Trims easily,"This is the best trimmer I have ever owned.  I have large hands, but this with its rubber sides handles beautifully.  It is quiet and doesn't vibrate.  When I go for a haircut,  I take my Remington with me.  Her Whal trimmer makes my fillings feel like they are about to come out."
12/12/2018,Amazon,1,"Like most ""Bosses""...it doesn't actually work!","1 - it has 2 settings, slower and faster....silly because the slower is so slow it's pointless....""faster"" is really just ""normal"" speed. So always use ""faster"" mode to get ""normal"" speed. 2 - I have to go over the same spot soooooo many times (with the foil attachment) 3 - Save $50 and just get the “Remington PG6025 All-in-1 Lithium Powered Grooming Kit, Black”. It works better and is only about $20. I mean you can tell it’s built “cheaper”…but it still cuts better than this super high quality useless machine. 4 – ok maybe not “useless” the only way this is better than the $20 Remington is this one has an ear/nose hair attachment that’s actually pretty cool. That’s the only reason why I’m keeping it. So basically I bought a $50 ear/nose hair trimmer. If the attachment was compatible with the $20 Remington I’d totally throw away the $50 one and just keep the attachment."

12/19/2018,Amazon,5,Great item.,Best of quality and works well. Best buy.
12/22/2018,Amazon,2,Cheap,Lasted me 1 year then the battery died. Quite mad
12/24/2018,Amazon,5,"Beard, Crotch, Shaft, It Works","Been shaving for almost 30 years now and this is the best trimmer I've ever used.  Great for the crotch too, does not snag skin!"
12/26/2018,Amazon,5,"Nice trimmer, very happy so far.","It does a great job with regard to trimming/cutting. It keeps a pretty nice charge. It doesn't take ""too"" long to fully charge (but then charging is never fast enough lol). My only ""complaint"" is that the length settings are not granular enough. I can never quite find the right length. One setting is too long the next one down is a bit too short.  Not a big deal though."
12/26/2018,Amazon,5,Great trimmer!,Gave this trimmer to my husband for his birthday. He absolutely loves it! The detail head helps him in trimming the edge of his beard perfectly. The battery lasts several hours so no need to recharge constantly.
12/27/2018,Amazon,5,Great product,For the price this is amazing. Got this on a special.
12/27/2018,Amazon,5,Fast shipping,Great value. Great product
12/28/2018,Amazon,5,Nice.,Works  as advertised
12/29/2018,Amazon,5,Love it!,Boyfriend loves it uses it on his beard all the time.
12/29/2018,Amazon,5,Works great,Worth the money in my opinion
12/29/2018,Amazon,5,Great Value,A lot of options available with the different combs/brushes
12/30/2018,Amazon,5,Quality trimmer,"Works well, better than the cheaper trimmers they have at my local stores."
12/30/2018,Amazon,5,Works great,I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he said it works excellent. He charged it up and used it without the cord. He had a full beard and was going to just trim it up but he made a mistake and ended up shaving the whole thing off and it held the charge for the whole time.
1/2/2019,Amazon,5,Battery made by Stark Industries,By far the best beard trimmer I’ve ever had. My wife bought this for me in October and it’s now January and I still have not had to charge this thing! Works great in and out of the shower. Highly recommend this!
1/2/2019,Amazon,1,Power button broke after first use,"I trimmed/shaved with this once, rinsing it in the sink now and then, and when I was done, the power button broke and only cycled through the power options about 1 in every 20 presses. So much for waterproof. This was my first and last experience with this brand.  And naturally, as I write this review, it turns on on its own. Seriously, don't buy this."
1/4/2019,Amazon,5,Awesome clippers,"Awesome set of clippers, I have had them for over a year, I have gone to different countries and charged them fine. I have had a lot of buddies and personal issue with clippers getting messed up with higher voltage. Stay charged super long highly recommend for a travel clipper."
1/4/2019,Amazon,1,Doesn't hold a charge,I bought it a bit more than a year ago and slowly slowly battery has been lasting shorter and shorter. Now it's not usable.
1/5/2019,Amazon,1,Horrible,If you want a close shave dont bother buying this . horrible
1/8/2019,Amazon,5,Wonderful Product - Neat cuts all the time,"excellent product. I haven't tried it in the shower though and I probably won't. The blades give a nice clean and the run tome is excellent. It's very easy to clean too. The only downside for me is that the width of the cutting blade is not very wide, hence coverage is on the downside. That aside i would highly recommend this product. Absolutely no regrets. This btw is an independent review, free from any company inducements."
1/10/2019,Amazon,1,Worked great...until it just stopped working.,"I really enjoyed this trimmer when I first got it at the end of August 2018.  I'm writing this on January 10th, 2019 and it already stopped working as of yesterday.  When it was working, it was great. The ability to use it in the shower was a big plus and it provided a close and precise shave.  HOWEVER, any trimmer in the price range of $40 to $90 should work for longer than a matter of a couple months.  Don't waste your money; put it towards another brand."
1/14/2019,Amazon,5,Good qaulity product,"Good qaulity product. I have owned this model before but was lost during travel. I decided to replace and it works very well. Durable, holds charge and included gaurds and accessories work well and easily interchangeable."
1/22/2019,Amazon,2,get the cheaper model,"get the cheaper model. I have owed this one and the cheaper version, they cut and operate the same. this has two speeds but the first speed is not strong enough for cutting so the cheaper model is better"
1/23/2019,Amazon,5,My man loves his Christmas gift,"He loves all of the interchangeable pieces that come with this.  The reviews outside of Amazon were very good for this razor, thus I decided to purchase.  So happy I did."
1/24/2019,Amazon,5,Cyber Monday Win,Despite having SEVERAL issues with the delivery of this product (took three tries) we are happy with the product.
1/27/2019,Amazon,5,My first trimmer,"More than enough attachments. Being my first beard trimmer, i had to figure out the angles to not cut too much, but look like i actually tried."
1/27/2019,Amazon,3,Stopped working after a year or so,I give it three stars because it stopped working after about a year and a half. Its works great tho.
1/27/2019,Amazon,2,Not a quality purchase,"I liked it and was pleased with how it functioned. However less than a year after purchasing it, it would turn itself on randomly and would not turn off until I pressed the button several times. I had another trimmer that lasted 8 years."
2/2/2019,Amazon,4,Nice,Nice kit.
2/5/2019,Amazon,5,Durable. Works as expected,Durable. Works as expected.
2/7/2019,Amazon,5,Genial,me encanto
2/12/2019,Amazon,5,GREAT PRODUCT,This product is amazing! It works so well for my husband and he loves the fact that he can just rinse it off when he is done. It has so many attachments and a wonderful little bag to keep it all in. Would buy again!
2/16/2019,Amazon,2,Bad design and broke after 6 months but replaced under warranty,I used this thing for about 6 months before it quite. The charge light comes on but it won’t power up anymore. I didn’t really like it even when it did work because the little clip that holds the cut length setting would slip and I shaved my bread off more than once. I had to keep my finger pressed on the clip to stop it from slipping  in fear of a bald spot every week. *I’m updating this review because Remington was very responsive and they sent me a replacement under the two year warranty. I still don’t love the design of the beard attachment so I can only use it to shave my head which means I wouldn’t recommend it regardless but at least they replaced it.
3/7/2019,Amazon,2,"Works well, but didn’t last","This trimmer worked exactly as I intended (though the ear/nose trimmer head is not super effective). It also holds a charge for several days. However, after 4 months of using it 4-5 days a week, in the shower and out, to maintain my stubble, the power switch is on the fritz. It had turned on by itself 1 or two times earlier, but one night, it simply wouldn’t stay off. So I’d turn it off, then within seconds it would turn on its own again, which repeated until I plugged it in.  Worked for a few more weeks, but recently, the power switch won't work at all.  Won't come on, no matter what I do.  Another reviewer wrote about this, and found that it was water damage to the switch.  So I wrote Remington (as the trimmer is supposed to have a 2 year warranty).  I'll update the review when/if I hear back from them.  The 2nd star is since for the price, I did get several months of good use out of the trimmer. But now I’ve got to find a replacement."
3/11/2019,Amazon,5,Great,Purchased for husband. He loves it.
3/13/2019,Amazon,5,What a deal.,Works very good.  Easy to use
3/15/2019,Amazon,5,Good,Good
3/16/2019,Amazon,5,Good quality shaver,Shaves smooth. Happy with my purchase!!
3/19/2019,Amazon,5,Excelente,Muy practico
3/19/2019,Amazon,5,Good,Nice product
3/21/2019,Amazon,5,It does every ting it is supposed to do.,I liked everything.
3/23/2019,Amazon,1,Not Durable,"After about 9 months, the switch stopped working. I suffered thru it for 3 more months until is started randomly turning one."
3/25/2019,Amazon,5,Barber like Details,"So it seems like Remington got their names swapped.  Originally purchased the Beard Boss MB4900 "" The Perfecter "" and it wouldn't even trim my stubble.  Extremely disappointed, so I returned it and got this Beard Boss PG6171 ' The Crafter "" and so far love it.  So I think Remington should swap the names as this is fairly close to being zero gapped also the detailer is close as well.  Although the foil shaver is on the smaller side, it actually helps to be more detailed with it.  I can shape my beard/ side burns and edge myself up with Barber like details.  All of which the ""The Perfecter"" couldn't achieve.  So far I can say I am very satisfied with this. This is a very quiet clipper even with turbo mode on and has a nice weight to it.  It cuts very soft so pressing hard will not actually cut the skin which is nice."
3/26/2019,Amazon,5,It is smoooooooooth!!!!!,"Probably the best item I have bought on Amazon, thus far. It glides effortlessly on my skin, as if in a romantic indulgence. Planning on getting one or two more, just for the fun of it."
3/29/2019,Amazon,1,Buyer beware. Instant water damage.,Not water resistant. Had two units. Both returned after failing within two weeks of use.
4/1/2019,Amazon,2,I think I wasted my money.,"The build is pretty poor. There are uneven gaps in the body. Also, I think I should have just got the non titanium version. Go for that one!"
4/4/2019,Amazon,5,good,works well
4/6/2019,Amazon,5,great product,great product
4/6/2019,Amazon,5,He likes it :),I got it for my husband and he really likes using it.
4/8/2019,Amazon,3,"Ok, but..","This was an ok buy, but with even limited use the main beard trimmer attachment broke inside and now it doesn't work. How can I get a replacement for the part?"
4/12/2019,Amazon,5,Good product,Good product
4/13/2019,Amazon,5,GOOD,GOOD
4/14/2019,Amazon,5,Great Buy!,"Best one I ever bought, no idea of water resistance though. Highly recommend! Nice for nose and ears too."
4/15/2019,Amazon,4,Good,It is good enough but doesn't shave smooth
4/17/2019,Amazon,5,Great value for money,"Everything does what it should so far. The adjustable attachment could slide up and down a bit smoother, but works fine."
4/20/2019,Amazon,5,Very good trimmer,"Solid product. I like the two speed motor. Changing heads can be problematic on occasion, especially if you have an issue with grip strength or arthritis. Does a very good job trimming."
4/20/2019,Amazon,1,Stopped Working,"I only used it a couple of times. NOW it doesn't even turn on, though the light illuminates!  WASTE OF MONEY!!"
4/23/2019,Amazon,5,Works like a charm.,Would buy again.  Battery life is amazing.
4/29/2019,Amazon,4,Great Razor,Works great. Great battery. Good quality. Nose hair trimmer blades could be the only improvement.
5/3/2019,Amazon,5,Sturdier than the rest,"Had this unit for more than a year before needing a new one. Charge lasts for hours, device feels sturdier than other cheap ones. Bought a 2nd one because others I’ve tried have all felt cheap. Great product."
5/3/2019,Amazon,2,Broke after six months of minimal use.,"Well, it was a good razor while it lasted. Six months seems like a short amount of time before breaking, considering that I only used it like once a week. One day, it just started cutting off a few seconds after I turn it on. So, yeah, it's broken.  Buyer beware."
5/8/2019,Amazon,5,Close shave with a long battery life,"I've used a variety of shavers and this one may be the best I've used for under $50. Whether on my face or chest this shaves the hair very short and leaves it feeling smooth. Great kit for the money, I'm very pleased!"
5/10/2019,Amazon,5,Great Gift for the Guy,I purchased this as a gift for my significant other. He uses it almost everyday. I wish my hair grew that fast. I haven't seen him go back to using his old one since. He loves it. No complaints.
5/11/2019,Amazon,5,"Light, easy to use",Great value
5/11/2019,Amazon,4,Great product!,I've been using this shaver for just over 2 months now and love it! I've cut mine and my boyfriend's hair with this twice now and it does a great job at it!
5/14/2019,Amazon,5,Great for my beard,"Easy to use, comes with a ton of tool attachments. Great deal for the price, I like it."
5/15/2019,Amazon,4,Not bad !,Not bad at all
5/16/2019,Amazon,3,"Awesome trimmer, cheap attachments.","I have had this trimmer for just short of 2 years and the unit itself is awesome. It's very sturdy, well built and the battery lasts forever. The entire time I have had it I have charged it twice. Typical Remington quality, and I wouldn't expect anything less. The attachments however, specifically the Adjustable Comb, leave something to be desired. Just over a year after I purchased the unit, the comb broke while trying to remove it properly to clean the unit. Because I loved the trimmer so much, I purchased a second one - brand new - on the second hand market for a good discount. Basically for 2x the price of the replacement comb and shipping from Remington I got a whole other trimmer.  I have been using the replacement comb for about 9 months with my original trimmer and had the same issue again. Exact same failure in the exact same way. I don't use it that much since I pretty much only trim my beard once every two weeks because it's curly and gets thick, not long. Now the price of the trimmer has gone way up, and Remington no longer sells the part. I broke down and purchased ANOTHER trimmer just for the clip (count it: I'll have three complete trimmers with two brand new).  Remington PLEASE just let me purchase bigger single-size combs so I don't have to use these terrible adjustable combs."
5/17/2019,Amazon,2,Crap,So I can't even turn it off. I'm done.
5/23/2019,Amazon,5,Good,Easy to use great
5/24/2019,Amazon,5,Excellent Groomer for the money,This is like many other Trimmers in the Market. It does everything it says it does.
5/25/2019,Amazon,2,"Great Trimmer, Cheap Accessories","I had the razor for less than 6 months when the plastic comb broke. This is apparently quite common. The only way this is useable is if I hold my finger against it the entire time to prevent the guard from slipping... Not ideal.  The trimmer itself was great when it worked, and the battery life on it was better than my 5 year old Philips Norelco.  I needed to replace the Norelco because the trimmer head no longer fit snugly in the base and would come loose unless I held that in place with my finger. However, the Norelco's plastic accessories are all still in tact years later and I didn't encounter the loose trimmer head until around year 3 or so.  Unless Remington fixes the design or quality of their attachments, I'll be switching back to Philips."
5/28/2019,Amazon,5,Does it all! Good quality,Fantastic purchase.
5/31/2019,Amazon,5,she's a champ,"She's a champ, works well. The adjustable clip is sturdy"
6/1/2019,Amazon,3,The good and the bad.,"It's ergonomics are friendly, rubberized. Attachment accessories seem to be durable. It would be nice to have lines to line up to ease installation.  This is why I would not buy it again: because it does not operate when it's plugged-in and charging and the strength of the battery and or motor seem weak but remain usable. So, the problem is if the batteries go dead you can't operate it while it's plugged in. That's the bad."
6/1/2019,Amazon,5,Durable and long lasting battery/charge,Has all the attachments that I could ever need. Easy cleaning and maintenance!
6/5/2019,Amazon,1,CAUTION- RUSTED WITHIN ONE YEAR,Even with careful usage in one year time the blades rusted. It was occasionally cleaned under tap water and left to dry in open air. Never used under shower. Still it rusted.  CHEAP METALS USED WITHOUT CORROSION PROTECTION.
6/15/2019,Amazon,5,Great for the money!,Very comfortable to use. 2 speeds. Never tugs or pulls facial hair. This is a great middle of the road trimmer. Would definitely buy it again.
6/15/2019,Amazon,4,We Had a Good Run,"I had this beard trimmer (one model number off, but identical in every other way) for about 5 years. The battery life was amazing (used every 1-2 weeks for 20 mins & would charge every 6 months) until it finally died about a month ago and now barely holds a charge (long enough to get a super quick trim in, if that). All the attachments make this trimmer incredibly versatile--short to long beard lengths, precision trimmer, touch-up foil shaver, body trimmer, and nostril trimmer. However, the contour of my jaw made it difficult for the trimmer to reach those hairs which forced me to trim over it numerous times and at different angles--it worked for the most part. Also, when I would trim my already short beard with something slightly shorter, it made it difficult to catch all the hairs and sometimes miss them altogether. Basically, let's say I let my beard grow out for a few weeks, and then trimmed it with a 6mm--it would catch ALL the hairs because they're super long and easy to grab. But say my beard length is at 8mm, and I trim it to 6mm, it would miss a good number of them because they're barely longer than the trimmer length itself. Because of this, I would usually let my beard grow long enough for the trimmer to catch all of them. Hairs would also get inside certain attachments and were impossible to clean. But the attachments worked great without being fully cleaned.  Overall, I would consider getting this again because I can't find any other trimmer that can do everything in one trimmer as this one can.  Pros: - Excellent battery life - Versatile for all parts of the body - Easily design your beard with precision  Cons: - Trimming my beard length to something slightly shorter than the beard length itself resulted in uncut hairs - Contour of my jaw made it difficult for trimmer to actually trim along my jaw and between my jaw and neck"
6/17/2019,Amazon,5,Didn't work very long - but the manufacturer came through with a replacement,"Remington came through - EXCELLENT customer service.  They just needed the serial number which was a little difficult to read, and they sent me a replacement within 5 days.  While I've had this Grooming kit for almost a year (October 19, 2018), I only used it about a dozen times.  I would expect it to last longer than that.  I kept it on the charger for >24 hours and now it doesn't work any more.  Before it tuckered out it would turn on automatically.  Now it doesn't turn on at all.  Wish there was a way to get a replacement.  I liked it for what it was worth in the < 1 year that I had it.  If there is some kind of replacement offered I'd definitely change my review to 4 to 5 stars."
6/19/2019,Amazon,5,Love it,"Have used this stubble trimmer now for about a month.  I trim about every two to three days to maintain the desired length.  Love the battery life, power when trimming and it is not as loud as my previous trimmer.  So far, so good."
6/20/2019,Amazon,5,Its very nice and easy,Its very nice and easy
6/21/2019,Amazon,5,Good value for the price.,I really like this razor.  It works great and it holds a charge for a long time.
7/3/2019,Amazon,2,Power button dead after a year,"This thing was great for the dozen or so times I used it over the past year. Then about a month ago I noticed the power button doesn't do anything anymore. It's charged fully and the light is blue when plugged in, but it just won't turn on. I'm super disappointed, since I had seen so many good reviews. Now I'm seeing a bunch that mention this same issue! I wish I'd noticed them before."
7/6/2019,Amazon,5,Worth it,Held up great so far.  It works well for a trimmer but not so much as a shaver.
7/7/2019,Amazon,5,Makes a great gift,Bought this for my hubby for Christmas and he loves it
7/12/2019,Amazon,5,Beard Trimmer,"The is my second purchase on this trimmer. I purchased one for my husband. He loves it!! Stays charged for a long time and easy to use. As a family, we were discussing how much we loved it and I purchased another one for my brother. I paid the extra to have it gift wrapped. So totally worth it to family/friends who live out of state!"
7/14/2019,Amazon,5,Sleek and Reliable.,"Stellar product, well worth it. Sleek design, reliable performance, durable, and comes with all of the accessories you might need. The adjustable length slider is convenient and functional, way easier than rummaging through your case for the right length clip. Plus, it looks nice so it's fun to use."
7/17/2019,Amazon,5,50$ but worth it in the long run as long as it keeps up,"I love this trimmer. It comes with all the necessary tools and lengths for a trimmer and it's so useful. However, I do wish they had a body trimmer and a mini length for the eyebrow but I'm happy still. Kinda wary since it's 50$ but considering I've paid 20-40$ for trimmers and have had a dissatisfaction with each of them, this was worth it. Comes with a  pouch too. I'm just more careful about keeping this clean because I like it. Also, fast trimmer option is cool too"
7/18/2019,Amazon,5,Very solid trimmer. Happy with it!,I had the previous Remington version for a while which worked great. I decided to purchase this one after the old one started to break down. I am very happy with this new version! I agree with other reviews in terms of the different trim attachments feeling much more secure than the previous Remington version. The trimmer itself feels very durable and well made. It works great and I'm very happy with it!
7/19/2019,Amazon,1,Poor switch,"The switch to turn it on/off started behaving soon after I bought this. It just won’t toggle no matter how hard you press. It has a little cushion support for the switch which in my opinion makes it worse. So one fine day it never got off, and it finally ran out of power to put itself off. That was frustrating, I will try another product in same or above range.  Battery life is average only. And cleaning it after usage is not easy as there are corners where hairs get stuck, have to run too much of water to get rid of them. Probably the reason my switch started misbehaving."
7/24/2019,Amazon,5,Works great,"This has been working great for about 6 months.  I've tried several other budget level clippers and trimmers, and all have stopped working or pulled hair painfully. This one does not, and has been cutting consistent."
7/24/2019,Amazon,5,Great trimmer,My husband loves this.
7/27/2019,Amazon,1,MASSIVE DISSAPOINTMENT! Killed by water damage!,"After hating myself wondering why this thing hasnt worked after only using it 4/5 months, I have finally opened it to discover that the rubber seperating the outer shell and the inner one just casually fell out, revealing a rusty and clearly damage circuit board right where the button is. I bought this thing because I needed a trimmer I could use in the shower, causing shaving over a sink is a lot of work, and it failed face down. What a waste of money.  No, I never opened this device before taking this photo and review. Like some other reviews, this ""5 star device"" would just randomly turn on or off, making creepy noises in the middle of the night and draining its own battery like a suicidal AI. Don't buy this if you want it to last more then a couple months."
7/30/2019,Amazon,5,Comfort,Great feel.
7/31/2019,Amazon,5,good,I like it Recomend buying
7/31/2019,Amazon,5,"Highly recommended, a must have.",Easy to use. Works great. Multiple uses.
8/1/2019,Amazon,5,Works great,I have been using the same beard trimmer for 5 years and did not realize how bad it was until I used this one. I can get a clean look and eliminate stubble with no problem at all. Have used it everyday for 2 weeks and still have not charged it.
8/5/2019,Amazon,5,Inexpensive grooming kit for men,Very easy to clean and keep charged
8/18/2019,Amazon,4,not enough sizes,could be better - not unique cut.
8/21/2019,Amazon,5,A+,Strong cutter with powerful Battery that last long very aldo easy to clean and change parts out
8/22/2019,Amazon,1,Works poorly,Honestly the worst shaver I’ve purchased with no attachments on it doesn’t even shave my neck clean I wouldn’t recommend to anyone other than that it looks nice that’s the best thing I can say about it
8/24/2019,Amazon,2,Lasted a year and a half...,"Not good. Lasted me 18 months of weekly use in the shower.  It started to rust after a year and recently it began to buzz loudly and performed poorly...battery life is good, cuts ok tho. I'm shopping for a new one now."
8/25/2019,Amazon,1,Loved it but is dying,I've owned this trimmer since Feb. 2017 its been great.  I use it once or twice a week at most.  it has been wonderful to use yet a few months ago the power button has begun to stick.  not It may take me as many as 100 tries to get it to run on and then again to turn off.  Is it even worth trying to get it repaired?  I'm so disappointed!
8/27/2019,Amazon,3,Bueno a secas,"Este producto que tiene la calidad de una marca como Norelco, ya que el acoplamiento de las piezas que forman el equipo no es completa y cuesta trabajo que algunas de las piezas se integren bien al primer intento; sin embargo, una vez que esto se logra, funciona adecuadamente."
8/27/2019,Amazon,2,Not effective,The foil shaver did not shave close. The motor was weaker than all the Norelco groomers I've had. I only used to a few weeks and replaced with a Norelco.
8/28/2019,Amazon,1,Worked Great - Until it didn't work at all !,"Loved this trimmer, great attachments, great feel, great battery life and could use in shower.  Then, about 4 months in, it started turning on by itself, would hear it in the drawer running.  I could turn it off and back on and it worked fine.  Now, it simply wont turn on at all and I am passed the return window.  If I plug it into the wall, the blue light comes on, simply will not start, plugged in or not."
8/28/2019,Amazon,5,great quality,it made by hi quality material
8/28/2019,Amazon,5,My boyfriend love it,I bought  this beard razor for my boyfriend and he loves it
9/8/2019,Amazon,5,Powerful battery,Very durable
9/14/2019,Amazon,2,"Works great, until it doesn't","I had another shaver like this that only lasted 6 months (the PG6171), much like this unit made it to 6 months. The current shaver being reviewed gets the second star for the equipment included and the fact that the clippers work really well. The poor overall rating is due to a switch failure (second set of clippers that had a switch problem) which causes unreliable operation. I can usually turn it on by pushing the button once or twice to turn it on to low speed, then another push or two will jump it to the high speed setting, and similarly another couple of pushes will result in it turning off. Not how it's supposed to work - however the more unsettling thing is that, for the past few months now, the clippers seem to turn themselves on at seemingly random times.  The kicker was this morning (which drove me to finally not put up with them anymore and submit a complaint to Remington) I went to use it, and could not turn it on. Push the button, nothing. Push it a couple of times, nothing. Then, after I got out of the shower and had dried off, the thing starts buzzing. It turned on about 5 minutes after I tried to turn it on. Tried to push the button to shut if off, no effect, the motor keep spinning. So I popped the head off to make it a little quiet, laid it in the sink (in case it burns up) and am letting the battery run down to zero.  At any rate, I hope Remington replaces the unit under warranty. If not, I will not be buying this model again."
9/15/2019,Amazon,5,price,Works as it should.
9/15/2019,Amazon,5,Great all around,"I love this trimmer. It's very versatile, easy to use and very sleek. My only complaint is every once in a while, it kinda bites you a little bit, but I've noticed that after you run it under some water and get some of the hair out, it goes back to normal. Other than that, I highly recommend!"
9/19/2019,Amazon,4,Broke & Replaced,"After one use it failed to ever hold a charge. No excuse for it instantly breaking.  Out of spite of this purchase I decided to let my beard go wild for a year before contacting customer service. The person I talked to was nice and got everything sorted out quickly. Stating the model I had has been seen and sent me a replacement. Fast, no hassle and arrived within 7 days. Full replacement with blade tips. Got to keep the old for spare heads if somehow i damage them."
9/21/2019,Amazon,5,Great brand,"Still running, year later and the blade is still sharp enough to keep the beast down."
9/26/2019,Amazon,5,Love it.,Gift for grandson.
